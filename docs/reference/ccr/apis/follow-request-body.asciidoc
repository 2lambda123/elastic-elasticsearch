`max_batch_operation_count`::
  (integer) the maximum number of operations to pull per fetch from the remote
  cluster

`max_concurrent_read_batches`::
  (long) the maximum number of concurrent fetches from the remote cluster

`max_batch_size`::
  (<<byte-units,byte value>>) the maximum size in bytes of batches pulled per
  fetch from the remote cluster

`max_concurrent_write_batches`::
  (integer) the maximum number of concurrent writes on the following index

`max_write_buffer_size`::
  (integer) the maximum number of operations that can be queued for writing;
  when this limit is reached, fetches from the remote cluster will be
  deferred until the number of queued operations goes below the limit

`max_retry_delay`::
  (<<time-units,time value>>) the maximum time to wait before retrying an
  operation that failed exceptionally; an exponential backoff strategy is
  employed when retrying

`poll_timeout`::
  (<<time-units,time value>>) the maximum time to wait for new operations on the
  remote cluster when the follower index is synchronized with the leader index;
  when the timeout has elapsed, the poll for operations will return to the
  follower so that it can update some statistics, and then the follower will
  immediately attempt to fetch from the leader again
