== Remote recovery

Remote recovery is the process used to build a new copy of a shard on a follower
node by copying data from the primary shard in the leader cluster. {es} uses this
remote recovery process to bootstrap a follower index using the data from the
leader index. This allows the follower to receive a copy of the current state of
the leader index, even if a complete history of changes is not available on the
leader due to Lucene segment merging.

Remote recovery is a network intensive process that transfers all of the Lucene
segment files from the leader cluster to the follower cluster. The follower
requests that a recovery session be initiated on the primary shard in the leader
cluster. The follower then requests file chunks concurrently from the leader. By
default, the process concurrently requests `5` large `1mb` file chunks as remote
recovery is designed to support leader and follower clusters with high network
latency between them.

There are dynamic settings that you can use to rate-limit the transmitted data
and manage the resources consumed by remote recoveries. See
{ref}/ccr-settings.html[{ccr-cap} settings].

Information about an in-progress remote recovery can be obtained using the
{ref}/cat-recovery.html[recovery API] on the follower cluster. Remote recoveries
are implemented using the {ref}/modules-snapshots.html[snapshot and restore] infrastructure. This means that on-going remote recoveries will be labelled as
type `snapshot` in the recovery api.
