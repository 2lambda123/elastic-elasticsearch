=== Remote Recovery

Remote recovery is the process used to build a new copy of a shard on a follower
node by copying data from the primary shard in the leader cluster. {es} uses this
remote recovery process to bootstrap a follower index using the data from the
leader index.

Remote recovery is a network intensive process that transfers all of the Lucene
segment files from the leader cluster to the follower cluster. The follower
requests that a recovery session be initiated on the primary shard in the leader
cluster. The follower then requests file chunks concurrently from the leader. By
default, the the process concurrently requests `5` large `1mb` file chunks as remote
recovery is designed to support leader and follower clusters with high network
latency between them.

Information about an in-progress remote recovery can be obtained using the
<<cat-recovery,recovery>> api. Remote recoveries are implemented using the
<<modules-snapshots,snapshot and restore>> infrastructure. This means that on-going
remote recoveries will be labelled as type `snapshot` in the recovery api.

The following _expert_ setting can be set to manage the resources consumed by
remote recoveries:

`ccr.indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec`::
    Limits the total inbound and outbound remote recovery traffic on each node.
    Since this limit applies on each node, but there may be many nodes
    performing remote recoveries concurrently, the total amount of remote recovery bytes
    may be much higher than this limit. If you set this limit too high then there
    is a risk that ongoing remote recoveries will consume an excess of bandwidth
    (or other resources) which could destabilize the cluster. Defaults to `40mb`.

`ccr.indices.recovery.max_concurrent_file_chunk`::
    Controls the number of file chunk requests that can be sent in parallel per recovery.
    As multiple remote recoveries might already running in parallel, increasing this
    expert-level setting might only help in situations where remote recovery of a single shard
    is not reaching the total inbound and outbound remote recovery traffic as configured by
    `ccr.indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec`. Defaults to `5`. The maximum allowed value is
    `10`.

`ccr.indices.recovery.chunk_size`::
    Controls the chunk size requested by the follower during file transfer. Defaults to
    `1mb`.

`ccr.indices.recovery.recovery_activity_timeout`::
    Controls the timeout for recovery activity. This timeout primarily applies on the leader
    cluster. The leader cluster must open resources in-memory to supply data to the follower
    during the recovery process. If the leader does not receive recovery requests from the
    follower for this period of time, it will close the resources. Defaults to `60 seconds`.

`ccr.indices.recovery.internal_action_timeout`::
    Controls the timeout for individual network requests during the remote recovery
    process. An individual action timing out can fail the recovery. Defaults to `60 seconds`.


These settings can be dynamically updated on a live cluster with the
<<cluster-update-settings,cluster-update-settings>> API.
