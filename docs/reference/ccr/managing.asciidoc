[[ccr-managing]]
=== Manage {ccr}
Use the following information to manage {ccr} tasks, such as inspecting
replication progress, pausing and resuming replication, and terminating
replication.

[[ccr-inspect-progress]]
==== Inspecting replication progress

[%collapsible]
.Use the API
====
You can inspect the progress of replication at the shard level with the
<<ccr-get-follow-stats,get follower stats API>>. This API gives you
insight into the read and writes managed by the follower shard task. It also
reports read exceptions that can be retried and fatal exceptions that require
user intervention.
====

[[ccr-pause-replication]]
==== Pausing and resuming replication

[%collapsible]
.Use the API
====
You can pause replication with the
<<ccr-post-pause-follow,pause follower API>> and then later resume
replication with the <<ccr-post-resume-follow,resume follower API>>.
Using these APIs in tandem enables you to adjust the read and write parameters
on the follower shard task if your initial configuration is not suitable for
your use case.
====

[[ccr-terminate-replication]]
==== Terminating replication

[%collapsible]
.Use the API
====
You can terminate replication with the
<<ccr-post-unfollow,unfollow API>>. This API converts a follower index
to a regular (non-follower) index.
