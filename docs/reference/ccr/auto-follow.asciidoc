=== Automatically Following Indices

beta[]

In time-series use-cases where new indices that you want to follow are
periodically created (e.g., daily Beats indices), manually configuring follower
indices for each new leader index can be an operational burden. The auto-follow
functionality in {ccr} is aimed at easing this burden. With the auto-follow
functionality, you can configure that newly created indices in a remote cluster
with a name that matches a pattern are automatically followed as they are
created.

==== Managing auto-follow patterns

You can add a new auto-follow pattern configuration using the
{ref}/ccr-put-auto-follow-pattern.html[create auto-follow pattern API].  When you create
a new auto-follow pattern configuration, you are configuring a collection of
patterns against a single remote cluster. Any time a new index with a name
matching one of the patterns in the collection is created in the remote cluster,
a follower index will be configured in the local cluster to replicate with the
new index as its leader index.

You can inspect all configured auto-follow pattern collections using the
{ref}/ccr-get-auto-follow-pattern.html[get auto-follow pattern API], and delete a
configured auto-follow pattern collection using the
{ref}ccr-delete-auto-follow-pattern.html[delete auto-follow pattern API].

Since auto-follow functionality is handled automatically in the background on
your behalf, error reporting is done through logs on the elected master node,
and through the {ref}/ccr-get-stats.html[{ccr} stats API].
