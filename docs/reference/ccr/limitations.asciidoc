[[ccr-limitations]]
== CCR Limitations

As {ccr} is designed to replicate user-generated indices only, all
<<system-indices,system indices>>, <<machine-learning,machine learning jobs>>,
<<index-templates,index templates>>, <<ilm,index lifecycle management>> and
<<slm,snapshot lifecycle management>> policies, <<user-roles,user role settings
and mappings>>, <<snapshot-repositories,snapshot repository settings>> and
<<cluster-settings,cluster settings>> currently do not support getting
replicated via {ccr}. 

[discrete]


[[ccr-system-indices]]
=== System indices

All <<system-indices,system indices>> are not designed to be replicated using
{ccr}.  This includes:
[unordered]
APM:: All APM configurations stored in `.apm*`.
Elastic Security:: All SIEM objects.
EnterpriseSearch:: All enterprise Search system objects stored in `.ent-search*`.
Fleet:: All fleet agent actions and configurations stored in `.fleet*`.
Kibana:: Saved objects (including visualization, reporting, alerts etc)
currently stored in `.kibana*` or `.reporting*`. 
Machine Learning:: All machine learning jobs.
Watcher:: All watcher definition and execution history.

[[ccr-index-templates]]
=== Index templates

{ccr} does not support replicating index templates across clusters, please
replicate them to a remote cluster manually.

[[ccr-ilm-slm-policies]]
=== ILM/SLM Policies

Both <<ilm,index lifecycle management>> and <<slm,snapshot lifecycle
management>> polices are stored locally in cluster state. {ccr} does not
support replicating these policies, please replicate them to a remote cluster
manually. 

[[ccr-snapshot-settings]]
=== Snapshot Settings

Snapshot repository settings are stored locally in the cluster state. {ccr}
does not support replicating these settings, please replicate them to a remote
cluster manually. 

[[ccr-searchable-snapshots]]
=== Searchable Snapshots

The actual data for <<searchable-snapshots, searchable snapshot>> indices are 
stored in the snapshot repository while indices are either partially-cached or
fully-cached on the Elasticearch nodes, {ccr} will not replicate the searchable
snapshot correctly. You can still set up snapshot repositories on the remote
cluster and use the same ilm policy to move data into cold or frozen tier thus
achieving searchable snapshots in the remote cluster. Data stored in the cold
and frozen tier are expected to be read-only, thus only replicate the data in
the hot and warm tier and moving them into searchable snapshots in the cold or
frozen tier will achieve the same effect. See <<ilm-searchable-snapshot, ILM
searchable snapshot action>> for more details.

[[ccr-user-role-permission-mapping]]
=== User/Role Permission and Mapping

User permissions and role mappings are stored as part of the cluster state.
{ccr} does not support replicating these settings, please replicate them to a
remote cluster manually. 

[[ccr-cluster-settings]]
=== Cluster Settings
{ccr} does not support replicating cluster settings, please replicate them to a
remote cluster manually.
