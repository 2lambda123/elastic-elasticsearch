== Back up a cluster

As with any software that stores data, it is important to routinely back up your
data. {es} replicas provide high availability during runtime; they enable you to
tolerate sporadic node loss without an interruption of service.

Replicas do not provide protection from catastrophic failure, however. For that,
you need a real backup of your clusterâ€”a complete copy in case something goes
wrong.

To back up your cluster, you can use the <<modules-snapshots,snapshot API>>.
