=== Back up a cluster's configuration

<titleabbrev>Back up the cluster configuration</titleabbrev>

In addition to backing up the data in a cluster, it is important to back up its configuration--especially when the cluster becomes large and difficult to
reconstruct.

Configuration information resides in
<<config-files-location, regular text files>> on every cluster node. Sensitive
setting values, like for example passwords for
Watcher's notification servers, are specified inside a binary secure container,
the <<secure-settings, elasticsearch.keystore>> file. Moreover, some setting
values are file paths to the associated configuration data, for example the
ingest geo ip database. All these files are contained inside the `ES_PATH_CONF`
directory.

NOTE: All changes to configuration files are done by manually editing the files
or using command line utilities, but *not* through APIs. In practice, these
changes are infrequent after the initial setup.

We recommend that you take regular (ideally, daily) backups of your {es} config
(`$ES_PATH_CONF`) directory using the file backup software of your choice.
Because some of these files may contain sensitive data such as passwords and
TLS keys, you should investigate whether your backup software and/or storage
solution are able to encrypt this data.

Using the <<cluster-update-settings, cluster settings API>> it is possible to
override some settings from configuration files. You can capture these in a
*data* backup snapshot by specifying the `include_global_state: true` (default)
parameter to the snapshot API. Using the
<<cluster-get-settings, get settings API>> it is also possible to extract these
configuration values in a text format:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET _cluster/settings?pretty&flat_settings&filter_path=persistent
--------------------------------------------------
//CONSOLE
//TEST

You can store the output of this as a file together with the rest of
configuration files.

NOTE: Transient settings are not considered for backup.

TIP: We recommend that you have a configuration management plan for these
configuration files. You may wish to check them into version control, or
provision them though your choice of configuration management tool.

NOTE: {es} {security-features} store configuration data, like for example role
definitions and API keys, inside a dedicate special index. This "system" data,
complements the <<secure-settings, security settings>> configuration and should
<<backup-security-index-configuration, backed up as well>>.

NOTE: Other {stack} components, like Kibana and {ml-cap}, store their configuration
data inside other dedicated indices. From the {es} perspective these are just data
so you can use the regular <<backup-cluster-data, data backup>> process.
