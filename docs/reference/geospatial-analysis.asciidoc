Geospatial analysis with speed, at scale. All with a stack that scales automatically.

The Elastic Stack is more than search. Use machine learning and alerting to put your geo data to work for you.

[[geospatial-mapping]]
== Geospatial mapping

Elasticsearch supports two types of geo data: <<geo_point>> fields which support lat/lon pairs, and <<geo_shape>> fields, which support points, lines, circles, polygons, multi-polygons, etc. Use <<explicit-mapping,explicit mapping>> to index geo data fields.

Have an index with lat/lon pairs but no geo_point mapping? Use <<runtime-mapping-fields,runtime fields>> to make a geo_point field without reindexing.

[[geospatial-ingest]]
== Ingest

Data is often messy and incomplete. Elasticearch <<ingest,ingest pipelines>> let you clean, transform, and augment your data before indexing. 

* Use <<geoip-processor>> to add geographical location of an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
* Use <<ingest-geo-grid-processor,geo-grid processor>> to convert grid tile or cell ids to regular bounding boxes or polygons which describe their shape.
* Use <<geo-match-enrich-policy-type,geo_match enrich policy>> for reverse geocoding. For example, use {reverse-geocoding-tutorial.html}/maps.html[reverse geocoding] to visualize urban areas by web traffic.

[[geospatial-query]]
== Query

<<geo-queries,Geo queries>> will help you answer location-driven questions.

[discrete]
[[geospatial-aggregate]]
== Aggregate

[discrete]
[[geospatial-integrate]]
== Integrate

Use <<search-vector-tile-api,vector tile search API>> to consume Elasticsearch geo data within existing GIS investments.

[discrete]
[[geospatial-visualize]]
== Visualize

Visualize geo data with {kibana-ref}/maps.html[Kibana]. Add your map to a {kibana-ref}/dashboard.html[dashboard] to view your data from all angles.

[discrete]
[[geospatial-ml]]
== Machine learning

Put machine learning to work for you and find the data that should stand out with anomaly detections. Find credit card transactions that occur in an unusual locations or a web request that has an unusual source location. {ml-docs}/geographic-anomalies.html[Location-based anomaly detections] make it easy to find and explore and compare anomalies with their typical locations.

[discrete]
[[geospatial-alerting]]
== Alerting

Let your location data drive insights and action with {kibana-ref}/geo-alerting.html[geographic alerts]. Commonly referred to as geo-fencing, track moving objects as they enter or exit a boundary to receive notifications through common business systems (email, Slack, Teams, PagerDuty, and more).

Interested in learning more? Follow {kibana-ref}/asset-tracking-tutorial.html[step-by-step instructructions] for setting up tracking containment alerts to monitor moving vehicles.
