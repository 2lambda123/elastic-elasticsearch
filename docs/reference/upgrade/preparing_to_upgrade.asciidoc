=== Preparing to upgrade

Before you start to upgrade your cluster to version {version}.

. Check the <<deprecation-logging, deprecation log>> to see if you are using any
deprecated features and update your code accordingly.

. Review the <<breaking-changes,breaking changes>> and make any necessary
changes to your code and configuration for version {version}.

. If you use custom plugins, make sure compatible versions are available.

. Test upgrades in a dev environment before upgrading your production cluster.

. <<modules-snapshots,Back up your data by taking a snapshot!>> Once you have
started to upgrade your cluster to version {version} you must complete the
upgrade. Rolling a node back to an earlier version is not possible, because
nodes of version {version} write data in their data paths using a format that
earlier versions cannot read. The only way to revert an incomplete upgrade is to
completely delete the contents of the data path on each upgraded node. If this
results in data loss then you will need to restore the lost data from a
snapshot.
