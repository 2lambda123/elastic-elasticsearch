== {dlm-init}: Manage your data lifecycle

preview::[]

{dlm-cap} ({dlm-init}) enables you to automatically manage data streams
according to your retention requirements. For example, you could use {dlm-init} to:

* Ensure that data indexed in a data stream will be kept at least for the retention time you defined.
* Older data will be deleted by {es} any moment later in time considering {es}'s performance.

You can create a data stream via index templates and configure your data lifecycle as part of the index template or you
can do it later on an existing data stream via the <<data-lifecycle-management-api, {dlm-init} APIs>>.

In the following sections, we will go through the following tutorials:
