You can't restore a snapshot to an earlier version of {es}. For example, you can't
restore a snapshot taken in 7.6.0 to a cluster running 7.5.0.

[[snapshot-prerelease-build-compatibility]]
NOTE: This documentation is for {es} version {version}, which is not yet
released. The compatibility table above applies only to snapshots taken in a
released version of {es}. If you're testing a pre-release build of {es} then you
can still restore snapshots taken in earlier released builds as permitted by
this compatibility table. You can also take snapshots using your pre-release
build, and restore them using the same build. However once a pre-release build
of {es} has written to a snapshot repository you must not use the same
repository with other builds of {es}, even if the builds have the same version.
Different pre-release builds of {es} may use different and incompatible
repository layouts. If the repository layout is incompatible with the {es} build
in use then taking and restoring snapshots may result in errors or may appear to
succeed having silently lost some data. You should discard your repository
before using a different build.
