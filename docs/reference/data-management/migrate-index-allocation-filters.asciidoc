== Migrate index allocation filters to node roles

If you currently use custom node attributes and
<<<<shard-allocation-filtering, attribute-based allocation filters>> to move indices
through data tiers in a hot-warm-cold architecture, we recommend that you switch to using
the built-in node roles and automatic <<data-tier-shard-filtering, data tier allocation>>.
Using node roles enables {ilm-init} to automatically move indices between data tiers.
To modify the number of replicas as the index moves between tiers,
you can specify an allocate action with no allocation filters.

NOTE: While we recommend relying on automatic data tier allocation to manage your data
in a hot-warm-cold architecture,
you can still use attribute-based allocation filters to control shard allocation for other purposes.

To switch to using node roles:

. Assign your nodes to the appropriate <<data-tiers, data tier>> using the
`data_hot`, `data_content`, `data_warm`, `data_cold`, and `data_frozen` roles.
When you add a data tier to an {ess} deployment,
nodes are automatically assigned to the tier.
You can change the role of an existing node in an {ess} deployment with the
{cloud}/ec-api-deployment-crud.html#ec_update_a_deployment[Update deployment API].
If you are directly managing your own cluster,
configure the appropriate data role for each node in `elasticsearch.yml`.
. Update your {ilm-init} policy to:
.. Remove the attribute-based allocation settings From the {ilm-init}
allocate action in each phase, or remove the allocate action entirely
if it does not set the number of replicas. (An empty allocate action is invalid.)
.. Ensure the policy specifies the corresponding phase for each data tier in your architecture.
For example, if you enable the warm and cold data tiers for a deployment, your policy must
include the hot, warm, and cold phases.
This is necessary for {ilm-init} to automatically inject the <<ilm-migrate, migrate>> action
to move indices through the data tiers,
even if you don't need to perform any other actions and the phase is empty.
. Update your index template to remove the custom node attribute you used to assign new indices
to the hot tier. Going forward, when you create a data stream, its first backing index is automatically
assigned to `data_hot` nodes. Similarly, when you directly create an index, it
is automatically assigned to `data_content` nodes.
The same nodes can serve both the `data_hot` and `data_content` roles.

To enable {ilm} to automatically move _existing_ managed indices through the data tiers,
remove the routing allocation filters from the indices and set the `_tier_preference`.
For example, if your old template set the `data` attribute to `hot` to allocate shards to the hot tier,
set the `data` attribute to `null` to remove the filter and set the `_tier_preference` instead.
