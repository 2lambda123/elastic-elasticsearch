=== Top Metrics Aggregation

experimental[We expect to change the response format of this aggregation as we add more features.]

The `top_metrics` aggregation selects metrics from the document with the largest or smallest "sort"
value. For example, This gets the value of the `v` field on the document with the largest value of `s`:

      }
    }

Which returns:

`top_metrics` is fairly similar to <<search-aggregations-metrics-top-hits-aggregation, `top_hits`>>
in spirit but it should be faster in most cases because it can do its job entirely with <<doc-values>>
which are **much** faster to access than the `_source` which `top_hits` needs. 

==== `sort`

The `sort` field in the metric request functions exactly the same as the `sort` field in the
<<request-body-search-sort, search>> request except:
* It can't be used on <<binary,binary>>, <<flattened,flattened>, <<ip,ip>>,
<<keyword,keyword>>, or <<text,text>> fields.
* It only supports a single sort value.

The metrics that the aggregation returns is the first hit that would be returned by the search
request. So,

`"sort": {"s": "desc"}`:: gets metrics from the document with the highest `s`
`"sort": {"s": "asc"}`:: gets the metrics from the document with the lowest `s`
`"sort": {"_geo_distance": {"location": "35.7796, 78.6382"}}`::
  gets metrics from the documents with `location` *closest* to `35.7796, -78.6382`
`"sort": "_score"`:: gets metrics from the document with the highest score

==== `metric`

At this point `metric` supports only `{"field": "field_name"}`. Expect more to come here.

==== Examples

===== Use with terms

This aggregation should be quite useful inside of <<search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation, `terms`>>
aggregation, to, say, find the last value reported by each server.
