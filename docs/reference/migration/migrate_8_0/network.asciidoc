==== Removal of old network settings

The `network.tcp.connect_timeout` setting was deprecated in 7.x and has been removed in 8.0. This setting
was a fallback setting for `transport.connect_timeout`. To change the default connection timeout for client
connections `transport.connect_timeout` should be modified.
