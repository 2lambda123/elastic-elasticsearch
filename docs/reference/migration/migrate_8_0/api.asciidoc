.The cat node API's `local` query parameter has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `?local` parameter to the `GET _cat/nodes` API was deprecated in 7.x and is
rejected in 8.0. This parameter caused the API to use the local cluster state
to determine the nodes returned by the API rather than the cluster state from
the master, but this API requests information from each selected node
regardless of the `?local` parameter which means this API does not run in a
fully node-local fashion.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `?local` query parameter. {ref}/cat-nodes.html[cat node
API] requests that include this parameter will return an error.
====

.The cat shard API's `local` query parameter has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `?local` parameter to the `GET _cat/shards` API was deprecated in 7.x and is
rejected in 8.0. This parameter caused the API to use the local cluster state
to determine the nodes returned by the API rather than the cluster state from
the master, but this API requests information from each selected node
regardless of the `?local` parameter which means this API does not run in a
fully node-local fashion.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `?local` query parameter. {ref}/cat-shards.html[cat shards
API] requests that include this parameter will return an error.

.The cat indices API's `local` query parameter has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `?local` parameter to the `GET _cat/indices` API was deprecated in 7.x and is
rejected in 8.0. This parameter caused the API to use the local cluster state
to determine the nodes returned by the API rather than the cluster state from
the master, but this API requests information from each selected node
regardless of the `?local` parameter which means this API does not run in a

====

.The get field mapping API's `local` query parameter has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `local` parameter for get field mapping API was deprecated in 7.8 and is
removed in 8.0. This parameter is a no-op and field mappings are always retrieved
locally.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `local` query parameter.
{ref}/indices-get-field-mapping.html[get field mapping API] requests that
include this parameter will return an error.
====

.Post data to jobs API is deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The {ml} <<ml-post-data,post data to jobs API>> is deprecated starting in 7.11.0
and will be removed in a future major version.

*Impact* +
Use <<ml-api-datafeed-endpoint,{dfeeds}>> instead.

====

.Monitoring APIs no longer expose memory usage of segments.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The <<index-stats-api-request,index stats>>,
<<cluster-nodes-stats-api-request,node stats>>,
<<cat-shards-api-request,cat shards>>,
<<cat-indices-api-request,cat indices>> and <<cat-nodes-api-request,cat nodes>>
APIs no longer expose memory usage of segments, including memory usage per
data-structure such as memory usage of terms, points or doc values.

This change is motivated by the fact that memory usage of segments has
significantly reduced in Elasticsearch 7.7, to the point that segments are
unlikely a major contributor to heap usage anymore.

*Impact* +
Assume that memory usage of segments is close to zero.
