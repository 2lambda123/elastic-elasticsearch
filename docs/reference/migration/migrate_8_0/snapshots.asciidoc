==== Deprecated node level compress setting removed

For shared file system repositories (`"type": "fs"`), the node level setting `repositories.fs.compress` could
previously be used to enable compression for all shared file system repositories where `compress` was not specified.
The `repositories.fs.compress` setting has been removed.

Instead use the repository specific `compress` setting to enable compression. See <<modules-snapshots>> for information
on the `compress` setting.

==== Compression of meta data files is now on by default

Previously, the default value for `compress` was `false`. The default has been changed to `true`.

This change will affect both newly created repositories and existing repositories where `compress=false` has not been
explicitly specified.

For more information on the compress option, see <<modules-snapshots>>

==== The S3 repository plugin uses the DNS style access pattern by default

Starting in version 7.4 the `repository-s3` plugin does not use the
now-deprecated path-style access pattern by default. In versions 7.0, 7.1, 7.2
and 7.3 the `repository-s3` plugin always used the path-style access pattern.
This is a breaking change for deployments that only support path-style access
but which are recognized as supporting DNS-style access by the AWS SDK. If your
deployment only supports path-style access and is affected by this change then
you must configure the S3 client setting `path_style_access` to `true`. This
breaking change was made necessary by
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story/[AWS's
announcement] that the path-style access pattern is deprecated and will be
unsupported on buckets created after September 30th 2020.
