.JodaCompatibleDateTime is removed from scripting.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
As a transition from Joda datetime to Java datetime, scripting used
an intermediate class called `JodaCompatibleDateTime`. This class is
now removed, and is replaced by `ZonedDateTime`.

*Impact* +
Prior to upgrade, any scripts using `getDayOfWeek` must replace
this with `getDayOfWeekEnum().value`. After upgrade, any scripts
using `getDayOfWeekEnum` should replace this method with `getDayOfWeek`
as it now returns the `DayOfWeek` enum instead of an `int` value.
