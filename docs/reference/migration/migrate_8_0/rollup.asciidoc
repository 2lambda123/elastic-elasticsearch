.The StartRollupJob endpoint now returns a success status if a job has already started.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Previously, attempting to start an already-started rollup job would
result in a `500 InternalServerError: Cannot start task for Rollup Job
[job] because state was [STARTED]` exception.

Now, attempting to start a job that is already started will just
return a successful `200 OK: started` response.

*Impact* +
Update your workflow and applications to assume a `200` status response for
requests attempting to start a rollup job that has already started.
