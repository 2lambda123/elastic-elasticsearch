[[accept-default-password-removed]]
==== The `accept_default_password` setting has been removed

The `xpack.security.authc.accept_default_password` setting has not had any affect
since the 6.0 release of {es}. It has been removed and cannot be used.

[float]
[[roles-index-cache-removed]]
==== The `roles.index.cache.*` settings have been removed

The `xpack.security.authz.store.roles.index.cache.max_size` and
`xpack.security.authz.store.roles.index.cache.ttl` settings have
been removed. These settings have been redundant and deprecated
since the 5.2 release of {es}.

[float]
[[migrate-tool-removed]]
==== The `elasticsearch-migrate` tool has been removed

The `elasticsearch-migrate` tool provided a way to convert file
realm users and roles into the native realm. It has been deprecated
since 7.2.0. Users and roles should now be created in the native
realm directly.

[float]
[[separating-node-and-client-traffic]]
==== The `transport.profiles.*.xpack.security.type` setting has been removed

The `transport.profiles.*.xpack.security.type` setting has been removed since
the Transport Client has been removed and therefore all client traffic now uses
the HTTP transport. Transport profiles using this setting should be removed.

[float]
[[ldap-ad-realms-tcp-read-timeout-removed]]
==== The `timeout.tcp_read` AD and LDAP realm settings have been removed

The `timeout.tcp_read` Active Directory and LDAP realm settings have been
deprecated in favor of `timeout.response` since 7.5. They both have the exact
same effect but the new name clearly exposes that the timeout value represents
the time interval that the client waits for a response to a query.
