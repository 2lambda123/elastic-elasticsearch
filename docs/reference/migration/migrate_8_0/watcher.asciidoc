.Watcher context (ctx) is no longer modifiable.

====
*Details* +

Watcher supports dynamic variables that can be set and accessed by
different constructs during the execution of a watch. These are
available via `ctx.vars` (e.g. `ctx.vars.someVar = 1`).

Previously, watcher also permitted dynamic variables that could be set
and accessed within a single construct by direct modification of the
`ctx` itself (e.g. `ctx.someVar = 1`). This is no longer permitted,
all dynamic variables must now use `ctx.vars`.

*Impact* +
Use `ctx.vars` for all dynamic variables.
