[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +

    "...": "...",
    "api_key": {

[[breaking_710_java_changes]]
==== Java changes

[discrete]
==== Machine Learning: `allow_no_jobs` and `allow_no_datafeeds` deprecated in favor of `allow_no_match`
`allow_no_jobs` and `allow_no_datafeeds` API parameters are deprecated in favor
of `allow_no_match`. The old parameters are still accepted by the APIs but the
deprecation warning is emitted if the old parameter name is used in the request
body or as a request param.
High-level REST client classes will now send the new `allow_no_match` parameter.

[[supplier-searchlookup-arg]]
.The `MappedFieldType#fielddataBuilder` method now accepts a `Supplier<SearchLookup>` argument.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
For future feature development, we added a `Supplier<SearchLookup>` argument to
the existing `MappedFieldType#fielddataBuilder` method.
 
*Impact* +
No action needed.

[[breaking_710_mapping_changes]]
=== Mapping changes

[[mapping-boosts]]
.The `boost` parameter on field mappings has been deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Index-time boosts have been deprecated since the 5.x line, but it is still possible
to declare field-specific boosts in the mappings.  This is now deprecated as well,
and will be removed entirely in 8.0.0.  Mappings containing field boosts will continue
to work in 7.x but will emit a deprecation warning.

*Impact* +
The `boost` setting should be removed from templates and mappings. Use boosts
directly on queries instead.

[[breaking_710_networking_changes]]
=== Networking Changes

[keep-idle-and-keep-internal-limits]
.The `*.tcp.keep_idle` and `*.tcp.keep_interval` settings are now limited to `300` seconds.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `{network,transport,http}.tcp.keep_idle` and
`{network,transport,http}.tcp.keep_interval` settings now have a maximum
value of `300` seconds, equivalent to 5 minutes.

*Impact* +
If specified, ensure the `{network,transport,http}.tcp.keep_idle` and
`{network,transport,http}.tcp.keep_interval` settings do not exceed `300`
seconds. Setting `{network,transport,http}.tcp.keep_idle` or
`{network,transport,http}.tcp.keep_interval` to a value greater than `300`
seconds in `elasticsearch.yml` will result in an error on startup.

[discrete]
[[breaking_710_search_changes]]
=== Search Changes

[[max-doc-value-field-search-limits]]
.The `index.max_docvalue_fields_search` setting now limits the number of retrieved through `inner_hits` or a `top_hits` aggregation.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `index.max_docvalue_fields_search` setting limits the number of doc value
fields retrieved by a search. Previously, this setting applied only to doc values
returned by the `docvalue_fields` parameter in a top-level search. The setting
now also applies to doc values returned by an `inner_hits` section or
`top_hits` aggregation.

*Impact* +
If you use `inner_hits` or the `top_hits` aggregation, ensure
`index.max_docvalue_fields_search` is configured correctly for your use case.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_710_snapshot_restore_changes]]
=== Snapshot and restore changes

[[respository-stats-api-deprecated]]
.The repository stats API has been deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The repository stats API was introduced as an experimental API in 7.8.0. The
<<repositories-metering-apis,repositories metering APIs>> now replace the
repository stats API. The repository stats API has been deprecated and will be
removed in 8.0.0.

*Impact* +
Use the <<repositories-metering-apis,repositories metering APIs>>. Discontinue
use of the repository stats API.
