[[ilm-freeze-noop]]
.The ILM `freeze` action has been deprecated and will be a no-op in a future release.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The ILM freeze action is now deprecated. This is because frozen indices provide no benefit given improvements in heap memory
utilization. In 8.0 the freeze action will be a no-op and perform no action on the index, as the freeze API endpoint
has been removed in 8.0.

*Impact* +
Update your ILM policies to remove the `freeze` action from the `cold` phase.
