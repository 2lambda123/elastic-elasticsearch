=== Search changes

*Details* +
Highlighters now use the same framework to load their values as the

will be applied to the values of a keyword field; for example, a
field configured with a lowercase normalizer will return highlighted
snippets in lower case.

==== {dataframe-transform-cap} API changes

.Transform now writes `group_by` dates as a string.
[%collapsible]
====

formatted ISO string. Previously constructed transforms will still use `epoch_millis`.
You can configure and change the output format in the settings of the transform.
