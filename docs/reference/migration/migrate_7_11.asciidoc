[[breaking_711_search_changes]]
==== Search changes

[[highlight-normalization]]
.Keyword fields with a custom normalizer will use the normalized form when highlighting.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Highlighters now use the same framework to load their values as the
`fields` section of a search response.  This means that normalization
will be applied to the values of a keyword field; for example, a
field configured with a lowercase normalizer will return highlighted
snippets in lower case.
====

[[text-subfields]]
.Internal fields used for text search acceleration are hidden.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Text fields can add internal subfields using extra analysis to speed
up prefix and phrase searches. Previously these were exposed to
the field caps API and were available for searching directly. However,
they did not implement all query types and could return bad results
or throw errors if used via the query DSL. These subfields are now
internal only and cannot be invoked as searchable fields in queries.
====

[[significant-text-non-text-fields]]
.The significant text aggregation now throws an error if applied to a numeric field.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The significant text aggregation could previously be applied to a fields that
were defined as numeric, which made little sense and would always return an
empty result. Given that applying a text-specific aggregation to a non-text
field is almost certainly a mistake, this has now been changed to throw an
error.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_711_transform_changes]]
==== Transform changes

.Transforms now write `group_by` dates as strings.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Transforms now write dates used in a `group_by` as formatted ISO strings instead
of `epoch_millis` values. Previously constructed transforms will still use
`epoch_millis` values. You can configure and change the output format in the
settings of the transform.
