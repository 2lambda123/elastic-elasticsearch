*Details* +
In earlier versions a force-merge on a frozen index or a searchable snapshot
index would incorrectly yield a successful response without performing the
requested merge. This bug is fixed in version 7.12: from this version onwards a
force-merge on these immutable indices will fail if the requested merge is not
a no-op.
