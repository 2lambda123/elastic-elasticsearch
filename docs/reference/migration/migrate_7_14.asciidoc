==== Security deprecations

[[implicitly-disabled-security]]
.The default behavior of disabling security on basic and trial licenses is deprecated
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Currently, security features are disabled when operating on a basic or trial
license when `xpack.security.enabled` has not been explicitly set to `true`.
This behavior is now deprecated. In version 8.0.0, security features will be
enabled by default for all licenses, unless explicitly disabled (by setting
`xpack.security.enabled` to `false`).
