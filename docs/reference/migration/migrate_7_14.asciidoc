==== Security deprecations

[[reserved-prefixed-realm-names]]
.Configuring a realm name with a leading underscore is deprecated.

====
*Details* +
Elasticsearch creates "synthetic" realm names on the fly for services like API keys.
These synthetic realm names are prefixed with an underscore.
Currently, user configured realms can also be given a name with a leading underscore.
This creates confusion since realm names are meant to be unique for a node.

*Impact* +
Configuring a realm name with a leading underscore is deprecated. In 8.0.0,
it will result in an error on startup if any user configured realm has a name
with a leading underscore.
