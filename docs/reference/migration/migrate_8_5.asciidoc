==== CRUD changes

[[reject_unknown_bulk_actions]]
.Reject unknown bulk actions
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Requests to the bulk API comprise a sequence of items, each of which starts with a JSON object describing the item. This object includes the type of action to perform with the item which should be one of `create`, `update`, `index`, or `delete`. Earlier versions of Elasticsearch had a bug that caused them to ignore items with an unrecognized type, skipping the next line in the request, but this lenient behaviour meant that there is no way for the client to associate the items in the response with the items in the request, and in some cases it would cause the remainder of the request to be parsed incorrectly.
From version 8.5 onwards, requests to the bulk API must comprise only items with recognized types. Elasticsearch will reject requests containing any items with an unrecognized type with a `400 Bad Request` error response.
We consider this change to be a bugfix but list it here as a breaking change since it may affect the behaviour of applications which rely on being able to send unrecognized actions to Elasticsearch.

*Impact* +
Ensure your application only sends items with type `create`, `update`, `index` or `delete` to the bulk API.
