*Details* +
Plugins that extend DiscoveryPlugin may override getJoinValidator and
getElectionStrategies. These methods are implementation details of the
clustering mechanism within Elasticsearch. They should not be overriden.
In the next major release, plugins overriding getJoinValidator or
getElectionStrategies will fail to install.

*Impact* +
Discontinue using any plugins that override getJoinValidator or
getElectionStrategies in DiscoveryPlugin. You can see if any plugins
use deprecated functionality by checking the Elasticsearch deprecation log.
