=== Plugins changes

==== GCS Repository plugin

* The repository settings `application_name`, `connect_timeout` and `read_timeout` have been deprecated and
must now be specified in the client settings instead.

See {plugins}/repository-gcs-client.html#repository-gcs-client[Google Cloud Storage Client Settings].

==== Ingest Geoip Plugin

* In earlier versions, database files have been stored as gzip compressed files with the extension `.gz`.
Now the default database files that are stored uncompressed as `.mmdb` files. Any custom database files must
also be stored uncompressed. Consequently, the `database_file` property in any ingest pipelines that use
the Geoip Processor must refer to the uncompressed database files as well.
