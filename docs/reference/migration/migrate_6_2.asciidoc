=== All permission bootstrap check

Elasticsearch installs a security manager during bootstrap to mitigate the scope
of exploits in the JDK, in third-party dependencies, and in Elasticsearch itself
as well as to sandbox untrusted plugins. A custom security policy can be applied
and one permission that can be added to this policy is
`java.security.AllPermission`. However, this effectively disables the security
manager. As such, granting this permission in production mode is now forbidden
via the <<all-permission-check, all permission bootstrap check>>.
