=== Discovery changes

[float]
==== Cluster bootstrapping is required if discovery is configured

The first time a cluster is started, `cluster.initial_master_nodes` must be set
to perform cluster bootstrapping. It should contain the names of the
master-eligible nodes in the initial cluster and be defined on every
master-eligible node in the cluster. The
<<modules-discovery-bootstrap-cluster,reference documentation>> describes this
setting in more detail.

The `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes` setting is required during a rolling
upgrade from 6.x, but can be removed in all other circumstances.

[float]
==== Removing master-eligible nodes sometimes requires voting exclusions

If you wish to remove half or more of the master-eligible nodes from a cluster,
you must first exclude the affected nodes from the voting configuration using
the <<modules-discovery-adding-removing-nodes,voting config exclusions API>>. If
removing fewer than half of the master-eligible nodes at once then this is not
required. This is also not required when removing master-ineligible nodes such
as data-only nodes or coordinating-only nodes. Finally, no special action is
required when adding nodes to the cluster, only when removing them.

[float]
==== Discovery configuration is required in production

Production deployments of Elasticsearch now require at least one of the
following settings to be specified in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration
file:

- `discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts`
- `discovery.zen.hosts_provider`
- `cluster.initial_master_nodes`
