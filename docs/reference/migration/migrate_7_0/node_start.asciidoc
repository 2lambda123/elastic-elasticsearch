=== Node start up

[float]
==== Node start up detects and fails on obsolete indices
To avoid importing obsolete dangling indices, node start up will fail in following two situations:

* Starting up a non-data node that has shard data (e.g. dedicated master node or coordinating-only node)
* Starting up a non-data, non-master node that has index metadata.

This situation should only occur if the settings node.data or node.master have been changed. Following are the primary
situations to be aware of:

* A node previously configured as node.data=true and node.master=true is changed to node.data=false
* A node previously configured as node.data=false and node.master=true is changed to node.master=false
* A node previously configured as node.data=true and node.master=false  is changed to node.data=false and node.master=true

Beware that such changes done prior to the 7.0 upgrade could prevent starting nodes.
