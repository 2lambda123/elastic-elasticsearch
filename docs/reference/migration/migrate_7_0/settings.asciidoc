=== Settings changes

==== Percolator

* The deprecated `index.percolator.map_unmapped_fields_as_string` setting has been removed in favour of
  the `index.percolator.map_unmapped_fields_as_text` setting.

==== Index thread pool

* Internally, single-document index/delete/update requests are executed as bulk
  requests with a single-document payload. This means that these requests are
  executed on the bulk thread pool. As such, the indexing thread pool is no
  longer needed and has been removed. As such, the  settings
  `thread_pool.index.size` and `thread_pool.index.queue_size` have been removed.

[[remove-http-enabled]]
==== Http enabled setting removed

The setting `http.enabled` previously allowed disabling binding to http, only allowing
use of the transport client. This setting has been removed, as the transport client
will be removed in the future, thus requiring http to always be enabled.
