=== Logging changes

[float]
==== New JSON format log files in `log` directory

Elasticsearch now will produce additional log files in JSON format. They will be stored in `*.json` suffix files.
Following files should be expected now in log directory:
* ${cluster_name}_server.json
* ${cluster_name}_deprecation.json
* ${cluster_name}_index_search_slowlog.json
* ${cluster_name}_index_indexing_slowlog.json
* ${cluster_name}.log
* ${cluster_name}_deprecation.log
* ${cluster_name}_index_search_slowlog.log
* ${cluster_name}_index_indexing_slowlog.log
* ${cluster_name}_audit.json
* gc.log
* http.ports
* transport.ports

Note: You can override additional files by removing the unwanted appenders in `log4j2.properties`.

[float]
==== Log files ending with `*.log` deprecated

Log files with `*.log` using old pattern layout format are now considered deprecated
and newly added JSON logs ending `*.json` should be used.
Note: GC logs in a file `gc.log` are not going to be changed.

[float]
==== Docker output in JSON format

All docker console logs are now in JSON format. You can distinguish logs streams with a `type` field.
