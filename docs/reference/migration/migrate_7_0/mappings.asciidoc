=== Mapping changes

==== The `_all` meta field is removed

The `_all` field deprecated in 6 have now been removed.

==== The `_default_` mapping is removed

The `_default_` mapping has been deprecated in 6.0 and is now removed in 7.0.
Trying to configure a `_default_` mapping will result in an error.

If an index is created in 6.x with a `_default_` mapping in addition to a
concrete mappings, the `_default_` mapping will be removed on upgrade.

If an index is created in 6.x and only has a `_default_` mapping, which implies
this index is empty as otherwise indexed documents would have implicitly added
a type, then the `_default_` mapping will be renamed to `_doc` on upgrade.

==== `index_options` for numeric fields has been removed

The `index_options` field for numeric  fields has been deprecated in 6 and has now been removed.

==== Limiting the number of `nested` json objects

To safeguard against out of memory errors, the number of nested json objects within a single
document across all fields has been limited to 10000. This default limit can be changed with
the index setting `index.mapping.nested_objects.limit`.

==== The `update_all_types` option has been removed

This option is useless now that all indices have at most one type.
