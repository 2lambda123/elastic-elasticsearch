=== Java API changes

==== `isShardsAcked` deprecated in `6.2` has been removed

`isShardsAcked` has been replaced by `isShardsAcknowledged` in
`CreateIndexResponse`, `RolloverResponse` and
`CreateIndexClusterStateUpdateResponse`.

==== `prepareExecute` removed from the client api

The `prepareExecute` method which created a request builder has been
removed from the client api. Instead, construct a builder for the
appropriate request directly.

==== Some Aggregation classes have moved packages

* All classes present in `org.elasticsearch.search.aggregations.metrics.*` packages
were moved to a single `org.elasticsearch.search.aggregations.metrics` package.

==== `Retry.withBackoff` methods with `Settings` removed

The variants of `Retry.withBackoff` that included `Settings` have been removed
because `Settings` is no longer needed.

==== DeleteRequest, DeleteResponse
// Modify this statement once all document APIs have been migrated
`DeleteRequest` and `DeleteResponse` moved to the `org.elasticsearch.client` package
and do not reference types anymore. Under the hood, the high-level REST client
uses the new <<removal-of-types,typeless APIs>>.
