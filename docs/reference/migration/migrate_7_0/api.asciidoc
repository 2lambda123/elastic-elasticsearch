=== Breaking API changes in 7.0

==== Camel case and underscore parameters deprecated in 6.x have been removed
A  number of duplicate parameters deprecated in 6.x have been removed from
Bulk request, Multi Get request, Term Vectors request, and More Like This Query
requests.

The following camel case parameters have been removed:

* `opType`
* `versionType`, `_versionType`

The following parameters starting with underscore have been removed:

* `_parent`
* `_retry_on_conflict`
* `_routing`
* `_version`
* `_version_type`

Instead of these removed parameters, use their non camel case equivalents without
starting underscore, e.g. use `version_type` instead of `_version_type` or `versionType`.

==== Thread pool info

In previous versions of Elasticsearch, the thread pool info returned in the
<<cluster-nodes-info,nodes info API>> returned `min` and `max` values reflecting
the configured minimum and maximum number of threads that could be in each
thread pool. The trouble with this representation is that it does not align with
the configuration parameters used to configure thread pools. For
<<modules-threadpool,scaling thread pools>>, the minimum number of threads is
configured by a parameter called `core` and the maximum number of threads is
configured by a parameter called `max`. For <<modules-threadpool,fixed thread
pools>>, there is only one configuration parameter along these lines and that
parameter is called `size`, reflecting the fixed number of threads in the
pool. This discrepancy between the API and the configuration parameters has been
rectified. Now, the API will report `core` and `max` for scaling thread pools,
and `size` for fixed thread pools.
