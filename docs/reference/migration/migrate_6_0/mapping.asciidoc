==== Synonym Token Filter

In 6.0, Synonym Token Filter tokenize synonyms with whatever
tokenizer and token filters appear before it in the chain.

`tokenizer` and `ignore_case` are deprecated.
These parameters are still left for backwards compatibility
for indices that created before 6.0.
And elasticsearch ignores these properties for new indices.
