==== Synonym Token Filter

In 6.0, Synonym Token Filter tokenize synonyms with whatever
tokenizer and token filters appear before it in the chain.

`tokenizer` and `ignore_case` are deprecated.
These parameters are still left for backwards compatibility.
If `tokenizer` is set, this token filter will have the same behavior as 5.x.
If you need the same behavior as 5.x without `tokenizer` parameter,
`tokenizer` parameter should be set `whitespace`.
