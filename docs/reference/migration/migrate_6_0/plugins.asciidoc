=== Plugins changes

==== Mapper attachments plugin

* The mapper attachments plugin has been depecated in elasticsearch 5.0 and is now removed.
You can use {plugins}/ingest-attachment.html[ingest attachment plugin] instead.

==== GCE discovery plugin

* The GCE discovery plugin does not take anymore into account `es_port` GCE instance metadata. It only tries to
find nodes running on the GCE instance on port 9300.
