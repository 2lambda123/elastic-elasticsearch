=== Mapping changes

==== Coercion of boolean fields

Previously, Elasticsearch recognized the strings `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`, `0`, `1` as booleans. Elasticsearch 6.0
recognizes only `true` and `false` as boolean and will throw an error otherwise. For backwards compatibility purposes, during the 6.x
series the previous coercion rules will continue to work on pre-6.0 indices. This means that you do not need to change affected existing
mappings immediately and can also read existing documents but for example the following operations will not be possible (even on
pre-6.0 indices):

* Adding new documents to existing indices that violate the strict `boolean` coercion rules.
* Creating new indices from index templates that violate the strict `boolean` coercion rules.

==== Unrecognized `match_mapping_type` options not silently ignored

Previously Elastiscearch would silently ignore any dynamic templates that
included a `match_mapping_type` type that was unrecognized. An exception is now
thrown on an unrecognized type.
