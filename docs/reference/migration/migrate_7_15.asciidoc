[[breaking_715_tls_changes]]
==== Security changes

[[tls-ssl-transport-enabled-required]]
.The `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` setting will be required to configure `xpack.security.transport.ssl` settings.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Configuring any SSL settings for
`xpack.security.transport.ssl` without also configuring
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` generates warnings in the deprecation
log. In 8.0, this configuration will result in errors.

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, either:

* Explicitly set `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` as `false`
* Discontinue use of other `xpack.security.transport.ssl` settings

If you want to enable SSL, follow the instructions to
{ref}/security-basic-setup.html#encrypt-internode-communication[encrypt internode communications with TLS]. As part of this configuration, explicitly set
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` as `true`.

For example:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true <1>
xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
--------------------------------------------------
<1> or `false`.
====

[[tls-ssl-http-enabled-required]]
.The `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` setting will be required to configure `xpack.security.http.ssl` settings.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Configuring any SSL settings for `xpack.security.http.ssl` without also
configuring `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` generates warnings in the
deprecation log. In 8.0, this configuration will result in errors.

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, either:

* Explicitly set `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` as `false`
* Discontinue use of other `xpack.security.http.ssl` settings

If you want to enable SSL, follow the instructions to
{ref}/security-basic-setup-https.html#encrypt-http-communication[encrypt HTTP client communications for {es}]. As part
of this configuration, explicitly set `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled`
as `true`.

For example:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true <1>
xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate: elasticsearch.crt
xpack.security.http.ssl.key: elasticsearch.key
xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate_authorities: [ "corporate-ca.crt" ]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> or `false`.
====

[[tls-ssl-transport-cert-required]]
.A `xpack.security.transport.ssl` certificate and key will be required to enable SSL for the transport interface.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Enabling SSL for the transport interface without also configuring a certificate
and key through use of the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path`
setting or the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate` and
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.key` settings generates warnings in the
deprecation log. In 8.0, this configuration will result in errors.

*Impact* +
If `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` is set to `true`, provide a
certificate and key using the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path`
setting or the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate` and
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.key` settings. If a certificate and key is not
provided, {es} will generate warnings in the deprecation log.
====

[[tls-ssl-http-cert-required]]
.A `xpack.security.http.ssl` certificate and key will be required to enable SSL for the HTTP layer.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Enabling SSL for the HTTP layer without also configuring a certificate and key
through use of the `xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path` setting or
the `xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate` and `xpack.security.http.ssl.key`
settings generates warnings in the deprecation log. In 8.0, this configuration
will result in errors.
*Impact* +
If `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` is set to `true`, provide a
certificate and key using the `xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path`
setting or the `xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate` and
`xpack.security.http.ssl.key` settings. If a certificate and key is not
provided, {es} will generate warnings in the deprecation log.

[[breaking_715_indices_deprecations]]
==== Indices deprecations

[[deprecate-6x-indices]]
.Indices created in Elasticsearch 6.x and earlier versions are deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In 8.x, {es} will only read indices created in version 7.0 or above. An 8.x node
will not start in the presence of indices created in 6.x or earlier versions of
{es}.

*Impact* +
Before upgrading to an 8.x version, reindex any index created in 6.x or earlier
versions with {es} 7.x. If you no longer need the index, delete it instead.
You can use the get index API to check the {es} version in which an index
was created.

[source,console]
----
GET *,-.*?human=true&filter_path=**.settings.index.version.created_string

====

[[deprecate-simpleifs]]
.The `simpleifs` index store type is deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `simplefs` value for the {ref}/index-modules-store.html[`index.store.type`]
index setting is now deprecated. Use the `niofs` value for superior or
equivalent performance instead.

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, discontinue use of the `simpleifs` store type in
new indices or index templates. Reindex any index using `simplefs` into one with
another store type.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_715_security_deprecations]]
==== Security deprecations

[[deprecate-accept_default_password]]
.The `accept_default_password` setting is deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In 6.0, we deprecated the `accept_default_password` cluster setting. We removed
support for default passwords in 6.0 but did not remove the setting for
backwards compatibility. In 8.0, we will remove the setting.

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, discontinue use of the setting.
====

[[deprecate-native-role-cache-settings]]
.Native role cache settings are deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In 5.2, we deprecated the following cluster settings:

* `xpack.security.authz.store.roles.index.cache.max_size`
* `xpack.security.authz.store.roles.index.cache.ttl`

These native role cache settings have been unused since 5.2, but we did not
remove the settings for backwards compatibility. In 8.0, we will remove the
settings.

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, discontinue use of the settings.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_715_settings_deprecations]]
==== Settings deprecations

[[deprecate-fractional-byte-settings]]
.Fractional byte size values are deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In 6.2, we deprecated support for fractional byte size values, such as `23.5pb`,
in:

* Cluster settings
* Index settings
* Cluster state metadata, such as an {ilm-init} policy, that support byte size
values

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, discontinue use of fractional byte size values in
your configurations. Update any existing configurations to use whole values.
