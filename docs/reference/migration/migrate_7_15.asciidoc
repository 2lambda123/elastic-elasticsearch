[[deprecate-6x-indices]]
.Indices created in Elasticsearch 6.x and earlier versions are deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In 8.x, {es} will only read indices created in version 7.0 or above. An 8.x node
will not start in the presence of indices created in 6.x or earlier versions of
{es}.

*Impact* +
Before upgrading to an 8.x version, reindex any index or data stream created in
6.x or earlier versions with {es} 7.x. If you no longer need the index or data
stream, delete it instead.

You can use the get index API to check the {es} version in which an index
was created.
