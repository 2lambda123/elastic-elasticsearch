=== Plugin changes

[float]
==== `ingest-geoip` and `ingest-user-agent` are no longer distributed as plugins

The `ingest-geoip` and `ingest-user-agent` plugins have been converted to
modules and are now included with all Elasticsearch distributions. Starting with
Elasticsearch 6.7.0, attempting to install or remove these plugins will result
in a no-op. In Elasticsearch 7.0.0, attempting to install or remove these plugins
will result in an error. Additionally, there are two minor breaking changes here:
- `elasticsearch-plugin list` will no longer output `ingest-geoip` nor
  `ingest-user-agent`
- `plugin.mandatory` is no longer compatible with `ingest-geoip` nor
  `ingest-user-agent`
