=== `_id` field

Each document has an `_id` that uniquely identifies it, which is indexed
so that documents can be looked up either with the <<docs-get,GET API>> or the
<<query-dsl-ids-query,`ids` query>>.

The value of the `_id` field is accessible in certain queries (`term`,
`terms`, `match`, `query_string`, `simple_query_string`).

# Example documents
PUT my-index-000001/_doc/1
{
  "text": "Document with ID 1"
}

PUT my-index-000001/_doc/2?refresh=true
{
  "text": "Document with ID 2"
}

GET my-index-000001/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "_id": [ "1", "2" ] <1>
    }
  }
}

<1> Querying on the `_id` field (also see the <<query-dsl-ids-query,`ids` query>>)

The `_id` field is by default not available by default for use with aggregations or sorting.
To aggregate or sort by the `_id` field, it is recommended to 
duplicate the `_id` field onto a `keyword` field using the <<copy-to, `copy_to` mapping parameter>>.

It is not recommended to enable `_id` fields to be aggregated using the <<modules-fielddata, in-memory field data cache>>,
but it is possible. This can be done by <<cluster-update-settings, changing the cluster setting>>
to `"indices.id_field_data.enabled": true`. Enabling this setting and then aggregating on the `_id`
field will use significant memory and show deprecation warnings in the logs.

[NOTE]
==================================================
`_id` is limited to 512 bytes in size and larger values will be rejected.
