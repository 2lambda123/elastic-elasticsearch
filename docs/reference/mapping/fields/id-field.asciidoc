=== `_id` field

Each document has an `_id` that uniquely identifies it, which is indexed
so that documents can be looked up either with the <<docs-get,GET API>> or the
<<query-dsl-ids-query,`ids` query>>. The `_id` can either be assigned at
indexing time, or a unique `_id` can be generated by {es}. This field is not
configurable.

The value of the `_id` field is only accessible in certain queries (`term`,
`terms`, `match`, `query_string`, `simple_query_string`), but is restricted
from use in aggregations, sorting, or scripting. For those use cases the
`keyword` type is recommended.
