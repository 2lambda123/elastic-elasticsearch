=== `_field_names` field

The `_field_names` field indexes the names of every field in a document that
contains any value other than `null`.  This field is used by the
<<query-dsl-exists-query,`exists`>> query to find documents that
either have or don't have any non-+null+ value for fields that have
`doc_values` and `norms` disabled. Only fields which have `doc_values`
and `norms` disabled and are present in the document will have values
indexed into the `field_names` field.

==== Disabling `_field_names`

Disabling `_field_names` is often not necessary because it no longer
carries the index overhead it once did. If you have a lot of fields
which have `doc_values` and `norms` disabled and you do not need to
execute `exists` queries using those fields you might want to disable
`_field_names` be adding the following to the mappings:
