[[mapping-shard-field]]
=== `_shard` field

Each document stores the shard id that it went into at index time. This is
typically useful for stable pagination when using `_shard` and either `_doc`
or <<mapping-seq-no-field,`_seq_no`>> as tie-breakers.

NOTE: This field was introduced in 6.0. As a consequence, 5.x indices do not
know its value and behave as if the shard id was the current shard, which might
be different from the shard that the document was initially indexed into in
the case of <<indices-shrink-index,shrunken>> indices.
