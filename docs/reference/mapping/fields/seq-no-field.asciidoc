[[mapping-seq-no-field]]
=== `_seq_no` field

A sequence number is assigned with each operation to the index. This is mostly
an internal field, which is especially useful to speed up recovery.

An interesting property of this field is that each document in a given shard
has a unique value for the `_seq_no` field, so it can be used as a tie breaker
combined with <<mapping-shard-field,`_shard`>>.

NOTE: This field was introduced in 6.0. As a consequence, 5.x indices do not
have values for this field.
