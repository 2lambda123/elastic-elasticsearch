[[sparse-vector]]
=== Sparse vector datatype

A `sparse_vector` field stores sparse vectors of float values.
The maximum number of dimensions that can be in a vector should
not exceed 500. The number of dimensions can be
different across documents.

These vectors can be used for document scoring.
For example, a document score can represent a distance between
a given query vector and the indexed document vector.

You represent a sparse vector as an object, where object fields
are dimensions, and fields values are values for these dimensions.
Dimensions are integer values from `0` to `65000` encoded as strings.
Dimensions don't need to be in order.

// CONSOLE

Internally, each sparse document vector will be encoded as a binary
doc value with the size in bytes equal to
`(INT_BYTES * 2) * NUMBER_OF_DIMENSIONS`,
where `INT_BYTES` - number of bytes used to represent an integer,
and `NUMBER_OF_DIMENSIONS` - number of the vector's dimensions.
