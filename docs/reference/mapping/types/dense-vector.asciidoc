[[dense-vector]]
=== Dense vector datatype

A `dense_vector` field stores dense vectors of float values.
The maximum number of dimensions that can be in a vector should
not exceed 500. The number of dimensions can be
different across documents.

These vectors can be used for document scoring.
For example, a document score can represent a distance between
a given query vector and the indexed document vector.

You index a dense vector as an array of floats.

PUT my_index/_doc/1
{
  "my_text" : "text1",
  "my_vector" : [0.5, 10, 6]

// CONSOLE

Internally, each document's dense vector will be encoded as a binary
doc value. Its size in bytes is equal to
`INT_BYTES * NUMBER_OF_DIMENSIONS`,
where `INT_BYTES` - number of bytes used to represent an integer,
and `NUMBER_OF_DIMENSIONS` - number of the vector's dimensions.
