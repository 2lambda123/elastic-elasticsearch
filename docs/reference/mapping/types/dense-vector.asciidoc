[[dense-vector]]
=== Dense vector datatype

A `dense_vector` field indexes dense vectors of float values.
Number of dimensions in a vector can be arbitrary and can be
different across documents.

These vectors can be used for document scoring.
For example, a document score can represent a distance between
a given query vector and the indexed document vector.

You index a dense vector as an array of floats.

// CONSOLE

Internally, each dense document vector will be encoded as a binary
doc value. Its size in bytes is equal to
`INT_BYTES + INT_BYTES* NUMBER_OF_DIMENSIONS`,
where `INT_BYTES` - number of bytes used to represent an integer,
and `NUMBER_OF_DIMENSIONS` - number of the vector's dimensions.
