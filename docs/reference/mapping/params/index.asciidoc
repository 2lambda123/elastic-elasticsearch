=== `index`

The `index` option controls whether field values are indexed.

[horizontal]
`false`::

    Do not add this field value to the index. With this setting, the field
    will not be queryable.

`true`::

    Add the field to the index so that it can be queried. The way that the field
    is indexed depends on the type. For instance a `keyword` field would index
    its entire value as a whole while a `text` field would be broken down into
    tokens first (also called <<analysis,analyzed>>) and then tokens would be
    indexed individually. At search time, the the query string is passed through
    (<<search-analyzer,usually>>) the same analyzer to generate terms
    in the same format as those in the index.  It is this process that enables
    <<full-text-queries,full text search>>.
