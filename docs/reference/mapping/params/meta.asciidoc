[[mapping-field-meta]]
=== `meta`

Metadata attached to the field. This metadata is opaque to Elasticsearch, it is
only useful for multiple applications that work on the same indices to share
meta information about fields such as units

// TEST

NOTE: Field metadata enforces at most 5 entries, that keys have a length that
is less than or equal to 20, and that values are strings whose length is less
than or equal to 50.

NOTE: Field metadata is updatable by submitting a mapping update. The metadata
of the update will override the metadata of the existing field.

Elastic products standardize on the following metadata, which you may use too
in order to get a better out-of-the-box experience with your data.

unit::

  The unit of the field. Recognizes `"byte"` as well as
  <<time-units,time units>>. By default, fields are assumed to not have a unit.
  This information should only be specified on numeric fields.

metric_type::

  The type of metric. Recognizes `"gauge"` and `"counter"`. By default, fields
  are assumed to not be a metric. This information should only be specified on
  numeric fields.

ratio::

  Whether the field is a ratio. Recognizes `true` and `false` (default). The
  value should not be `true` when a `unit` is also specified. This information
  should only be specified on numeric fields.
