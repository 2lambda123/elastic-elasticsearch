[[mapping-field-meta]]
=== `meta`

Metadata attached to the field. This metadata is opaque to Elasticsearch, it is
only useful for multiple applications that work on the same indices to share
meta information about fields such as units

[source,console]
------------
PUT my-index-000001
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "latency": {
        "type": "long",
        "meta": {
          "unit": "ms"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

// TEST

NOTE: Field metadata enforces at most 5 entries, that keys have a length that
is less than or equal to 20, and that values are strings whose length is less
than or equal to 50.

NOTE: Field metadata is updatable by submitting a mapping update. The metadata
of the update will override the metadata of the existing field.

NOTE: Field metadata is not supported on object or nested fields.

Elastic products use the following standard metadata entries for fields. You
can follow these same metadata conventions to get a better out-of-the-box
experience with your data.

unit::
+
--
The unit associated with a numeric field, preferably a case-sensitive http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html[UCUM symbol].
When a well-known unit is used, term and range queries support conversions within the same unit.
Also supports some non-UCUM symbols as well-known units for convenience and compatibility.
Well-known units:

|===
|Unit |Value of `unit` |Supported unit symbols in queries

|Byte size
|`By` (preferred), `byte`
|<<byte-units, byte units>>

|Time
|`ns`, `us`, `ms`, `s`, `min`, `h`, `d`
|<<time-units, time units>>

|Percent (`0.01` means `1%`)
|`%` (preferred), `percent`
|`%`
|===

According to [UCUM](https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum#para-50), symbols commonly used as units that are no real units of measurement can be used in curly brace expressions.
Examples: `{requests}, `{connections}`, `{threads}`

--
metric_type::

  The metric type of a numeric field: `"gauge"` or `"counter"`. A gauge is a
  single-value measurement that can go up or down over time, such as a
  temperature. A counter is a single-value cumulative counter that only goes
  up, such as the number of requests processed by a web server, or resets to 0 (zero).
  By default, no metric type is associated with a field. Only valid for numeric fields.
