{search-snaps-cap} enable you to significantly reduce costs by 
leveraging external storage for read-only data. 
Like snapshots used for backup and recovery, a searchable snapshot is a point-in-time copy 
of an index or data stream stored in a remote data store such as S3. 

Snapshot-backed indices use searchable snapshots for redundancy rather than replicas within the cluster. 
They support all regular data retrieval operations with performance comparable to a normal index.
In the event of a failure, data is recovered from the snapshot. 
Latency increases during recovery, but you can continue to query your data.

A snapshot-backed index essentially halves the number of nodes you need for read-only data. 
If you are using {ilm-init} to manage your data, in the cold phase it can 
automatically create a searchable snapshot, convert your index to a snapshot-backed index, 
and move it to nodes in the cold tier.

While searchable snapshots are separate from the snapshots used for backup and recovery, 
they are just snapshots. In fact, you can mount any existing snapshot as a snapshot-backed index. 
When you use the same repository for both types of snapshots, each snapshot is incremental. 
Files are shared among searchable snapshots and backup snapshots to avoid data duplication. 
This means that the additional storage costs for using searchable snapshots are negligible.
