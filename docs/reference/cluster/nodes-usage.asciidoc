=== Nodes usage

The cluster nodes usage API allows to retrieve information on the usage
of features for each node.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_nodes/usage'
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_nodes/nodeId1,nodeId2/usage'
--------------------------------------------------

The first command retrieves usage of all the nodes in the cluster. The
second command selectively retrieves nodes usage of only `nodeId1` and
`nodeId2`. All the nodes selective options are explained
<<cluster-nodes,here>>.

[[rest-usage]]
==== REST actions usage information

The `rest_actions` field in the response contains a map of the REST 
actions classname with a count of the number of times that action has 
been called on the node:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "_nodes": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "cluster_name": "my_cluster",
  "nodes": {
    "pQHNt5rXTTWNvUgOrdynKg": {
      "timestamp": 1492553961812, <1>
      "since": 1492553906606, <2>
      "rest_actions": {
        "org.elasticsearch.rest.action.admin.cluster.RestNodesUsageAction": 1,
        "org.elasticsearch.rest.action.admin.indices.RestCreateIndexAction": 1,
        "org.elasticsearch.rest.action.document.RestGetAction": 1,
        "org.elasticsearch.rest.action.search.RestSearchAction": 19, <3>
        "org.elasticsearch.rest.action.admin.cluster.RestNodesInfoAction": 36
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Timestamp for when this nodes usage request was performed.
<2> Timestamp for when the usage information recording was started. This is 
equivalent to the time that the node was started.
<3> Search action has been called 19 times for this node.
