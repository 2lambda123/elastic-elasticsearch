[[cluster-master]]
== Cluster master

The cluster master API returns the identity of the currently elected master
node.

// CONSOLE

By default the coordinating node asks the master for its own identity to verify
that it is still the master. The timeout for this can be set with the
`?master_timeout` <<time-units,time value>> query parameter, which defaults to
`30s`. This check can be skipped by setting the `?local` query parameter.
