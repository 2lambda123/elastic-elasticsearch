== Nodes hot_threads

The cluster nodes hot_threads API allows to get the current hot threads on each node in the cluster.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_nodes/hot_threads
GET /_nodes/nodeId1,nodeId2/hot_threads
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

The first command gets the hot threads of all the nodes in the cluster.
The second command selectively gets the hot threads of only `nodeId1` and `nodeId2`.
All the nodes selective options are explained <<cluster-nodes,here>>.

The output is plain text with a breakdown of each node's top hot
threads. Parameters allowed are:

[horizontal]
`threads`:: 	number of hot threads to provide, defaults to 3.
`interval`:: 	the interval to do the second sampling of threads.
				Defaults to 500ms.
`type`:: 		The type to sample, defaults to cpu, but supports wait and
				block to see hot threads that are in wait or block state.
`ignore_idle_threads`::    If true, known idle threads (e.g. waiting in a socket select, or to
			   get a task from an empty queue) are filtered out.  Defaults to true.
