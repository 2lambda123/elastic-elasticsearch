In order to decrease the disk usage in your cluster without losing any data is to reduce the replicas of indices.:
Reducing the replicas of an index can potentially reduce search performance and make the index less resilient to data
loss. However, it can quickly give the cluster breathing room until a more permanent solution is in place.

**Use {kib}**

//tag::kibana-api-ex[]
. Log in to the {ess-console}[{ecloud} console].
+

. On the **Elasticsearch Service** panel, click the name of your deployment.
+

NOTE: If the name of your deployment is disabled your {kib} instances might be
unhealthy, in which case please contact https://support.elastic.co[Elastic Support].
If your deployment doesn't include {kib}, all you need to do is
{cloud}/ec-access-kibana.html[enable it first].
+
. Open your deployment's side navigation menu (placed under the Elastic logo in the upper left corner)
and go to **Stack Management > Index Management**.

. In the list of all your indices, click the `Replicas` column twice to sort the indices based on their number of
replicas starting with the one that has the most. Go through the indices and pick one by one the index with the
least importance and higher number of replicas.

. For each index you chose, click on its name, then on the panel that appears click `Edit settings` and reduce the
value of the `index.number_of_replicas` to the desired value.

. Continue this process until the cluster is healthy again.

NOTE: After removing these replicas you need to consider if you still have enough replicas to ensure your search
performance and reliability requirements. If not, at your earliest convenience (i) consider using
<<overview-index-lifecycle-management, Index Lifecycle Management>> to manage more efficiently the
retention of your timeseries data, or (ii) reduce the amount of data you have by disabling the `source` or removing
less necessary data, or (iii) increase your disk capacity.
