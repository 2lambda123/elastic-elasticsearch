In order to increase the data node capacity in your cluster:

. Log in to the {ess-console}[{ecloud} console].
+

. On the **Elasticsearch Service** panel, click the name of your deployment.
+

NOTE: If the name of your deployment is disabled your {kib} instances might be
unhealthy, in which case please contact https://support.elastic.co[Elastic Support].
If your deployment doesn't include {kib}, all you need to do is
{cloud}/ec-access-kibana.html[enable it first].

. Open your deployment's side navigation menu (placed under the Elastic logo in the upper left corner)
and go to **Manage this deployment**.

. If autoscaling is available but not enabled, please enable it. You can do this by clicking the button
`Enable autoscaling` on a banner like the one below:

+
Or you can go to `Actions > Edit deployment` and check the checkbox `Autoscale`.

. If autoscaling has succeeded the cluster should return to `healthy` status. If the cluster is still out of disk
please check if autoscaling has reached its limits. You will be notified about this by the following banner:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/troubleshooting/disk/autoscaling_limits_banner.png[Autoscaling banner,align="center"]
+
or you can go to `Actions > Edit deployment` and check for the label `LIMIT REACHED`:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/troubleshooting/disk/reached_autoscaling_limits.png[Autoscaling limits reached,align="center"]
+
If you are in the banner click `Update autoscaling settings` to go to the `Edit` page. Otherwise, you are already in the
`Edit` page, click `Edit settings` to increase the autoscaling limits.
