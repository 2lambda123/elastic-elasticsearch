=== Discover the structure of text files

experimental[] The new <<ml-find-file-structure,find file structure API>> 
determines the structure of a text file. It also returns statistics about the 
most common values of the detected fields and mappings that you can use when you 
ingest the file into {es}. If you want to influence the output, you can specify 
optional parameters. For example, if the file contains semi-structured text, you 
can specify a Grok pattern or let the tool generate it. This API is also used by 
the new File Data Visualizer in {kib}.
