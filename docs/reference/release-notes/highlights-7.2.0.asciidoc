==== {dataframes-cap}

beta[] You can now transform your data with
{stack-ov}/ml-dataframes.html[data frames]. There is a new {kib} wizard that
guides you through the process of creating a {dataframe-transform} to pivot and
summarize your data and store it in a new index. Alternatively, you can use
{ref}/data-frame-apis.html[{dataframe} APIs] to preview, create, and manage
the transforms.

==== Closed indices are now replicated

Elasticsearch 7.2.0 brings a better support for closed indices by allowing
shards of closed indices to be replicated. As soon as an index is closed,
Elasticsearch takes care of tearing down the "opened" shards before
reinitializing them as "closed" shards, which require much less resources
while still providing the ability for shards to be promoted as primaries or
to be recovered from peer.

Note that only indices closed in Elasticsearch 7.2.0 are automatically
replicated. Indices closed on previous versions of Elasticsearch will
remain non replicated unless they are opened and closed again in 7.2.0.
