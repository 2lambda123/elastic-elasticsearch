==== Histogram field type

A new {ref}/histogram.html[histogram field type] has been added.  The new `histogram` field accepts
pre-aggregated histograms which can later be used directly in the
{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-percentile-aggregation.html[percentiles] and
{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-percentile-rank-aggregation.html[percentile_ranks] aggregations.
This allows users to pre-aggregate histogram data locally to the client and only send the final
datastructure, saving storage and network transfer, but still retaining the ability to
aggregate it like any other data.

==== Optimize sorting on long field types

Sorting on a `long` field now internally rewrites into a Lucene `DistanceFeatureQuery`.
This allows skipping non-competitive hits which leads to increased query performance.
In benchmarks this has sped up sorts on `long` fields by 10x.
