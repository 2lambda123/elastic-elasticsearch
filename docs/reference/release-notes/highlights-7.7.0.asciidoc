=== Significant reduction of heap usage of segments

This release of Elasticsearch significantly reduces the amount of heap memory
that is needed to keep Lucene segments open. In addition to helping with cluster
stability, this helps reduce costs by storing much more data per node before
hitting memory limits.

=== {transforms-cap}

We introduced {transforms} in 7.2.0 as a beta feature. It is now mature enough
to declare the feature GA (general availability). {transforms-cap} enable you to
pivot and summarize your data and store it in a new index. See
{ref}/transforms.html[{transforms-cap}] and
{ref}//transform-apis.html[{transform-cap} APIs].
