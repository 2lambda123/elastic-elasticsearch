=== {transforms-cap}

We introduced {transforms} in 7.2.0 as a beta feature. It is now mature enough
to declare the feature GA (general availability). {transforms-cap} enable you to
pivot and summarize your data and store it in a new index. See
{ref}/transforms.html[{transforms-cap}] and
{ref}//transform-apis.html[{transform-cap} APIs].

=== Finer memory control for bucket aggregations

We introduced a new `search.check_buckets_step_size` setting to
better control how the coordinating node allocates memory when aggregating
buckets. The allocation of buckets is now be done in steps, each step
allocating a number of buckets equal to this setting. A parent circuit breaker
check is performed on allocation, to avoid an OOM failure.

=== A new way of searching: asynchronously

Searches can now be submitted to a new endpoint, `_async_search`, that works
exactly the same as the `_search` endpoint, except that instead of blocking and
returning the final response only once it's entirely available, it will pan the
results as they become available, asynchronously.

The request takes a parameter, `wait_for_completion`, which controls how long
the server will wait until it sends back a response. The first response
contains among others a search unique ID, a response version, an indication if
this response is partial or not, plus the usual metadata (shards involved,
number of hits etc) and potentially results. If the response is not complete
and final, the client can continue polling for results issuing a new request
using the provided search ID; if new results are available, the returned
version is incremented and the new results batch returned. This can go on until
all the results are fetched.

Unless deleted earlier by the user, the asynchronous searches are kept alive
for a given interval. This defaults to 5 days and can be controlled by another
request parameter, `keep_alive`.

This functionality is offered under the free {xpack} Basic license.

=== Password protection for the keystore

{es} uses a custom on-disk keystore for secure settings such as
passwords and SSL certificates. Up until now, this prevented users with
command-line access from viewing secure files by listing commands, but nothing
prevented such users from changing values in the keystore, or removing values
from it. Furthermore, the values were only obfuscated by a hash; no
user-specific secret protected the secure settings.

This new feature changes all of that by adding password-protection to the
keystore. This is not be a breaking change: if a keystore has no password,
there wonâ€™t be any new prompts. A user must choose to password-protect their
keystore in order to benefit from the new behavior.

=== A new aggregation: `top_metrics`

The new `top_metrics` aggregation "selects" a metric from a document according
to a criteria on a given, different field. That criteria is currently being the
largest or smallest "sort" value. It is fairly similar to `top_hits` in spirit
but because it is more limited it is able to do its job using less memory and
is often faster.

=== Query speed-up for sorted queries on time-based indices

Sorted queries run on time-based indices and interested in top documents only
can be optimized by considering that the ranges of (document) timestamps in the
shards don't overlap. This optimisation will rewrite the shard search requests
based on the results available already from other shards when it can be
determined that the query will not yield any result from the current shard;
i.e. we know in advance that the bottom entry of the (sorted) result set after
a partial merge is better than the values contained in this current shard.

=== A new aggregation: `boxplot`

The interquartile range is a common robust measure of statistical dispersion.
Compared to the standard deviation, the IQR is less sensitive to outliers in
the data, with a breakdown point of 0.25. Along with the median, it is often
used in creating a box plot, a simple yet common way to summarize data and
identify potential outliers.
The new `boxplot` aggregation calculates min, max, medium, the first and the
third quartiles of a given data set.

=== AArch64 support

{es} now provides aarch64 packaging, including bundling an aarch64 JDK
distribution. There are some restrictions in place, namely no {ml} support and
depending on underlying page sizes, class data sharing is disabled.
