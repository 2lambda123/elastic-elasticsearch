Search::
* Scores computed using the BM25 similarity, the default similarity used by
  Elasticsearch, are lower than previously as one constant factor was removed
  from the numerator of the scoring formula. Ordering of results is preserved
  unless scores are computed from multiple fields using different similarities.
  In a mixed cluster with some nodes on 7.0 and some on 6.x, scoring will
  depend on where the shards are located: the older formula will be used for
  data located from 6.x nodes, while the updated one will be used for data
  located on 7.0 nodes.
