==== Voting-only master nodes

A new <<voting-only-node,`node.voting-only`>> role has been introduced that
allows nodes to participate in elections even though they are not eligible.
The benefit is that these nodes still help with high availability while
requiring less CPU and heap than master nodes.

IMPORTANT: The `node.voting-only` role is only available with the default
distribution of Elasticsearch.

==== Aliases are replicated via {ccr}

Read aliases are now replicated via <<ccr-put-follow,{ccr}>>. Note that write
aliases are still not replicated since they only make sense for indices that
are being written to while follower indices do not receive direct writes.

==== Fixed memory leak when using templates in document-level seciurity

{xpack-ref}/document-level-security.html[Document-level security] was using an
unbounded cache for the set of visible documents. This could lead to a memory
leak when using a templated query as a role query. The cache has been fixed to
evict based on memory usage and has a limit of 50MB.
