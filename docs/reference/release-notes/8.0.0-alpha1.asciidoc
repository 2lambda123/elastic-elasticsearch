=== Breaking changes

Aggregations::
* Disallow specifying the same percentile multiple times in percentiles aggregation {pull}52257[#52257]

Mapping::
* Dynamic mappings in indices created on 8.0 and later have stricter validation at mapping update time.
  (e.g. incorrect analyzer settings or unknown field types). {pull}51233[#51233]
* A "lowercase" normalizer now ships pre-defined in core for use in index mappings. Custom normalizers of the same name can still
  be declared in index settings and used but it is cleaner to use the core one or use a name other than "lowercase"
  if a custom normalizer is required. {pull}53882[#53882]
