=== Cross-cluster replication

We have introduced cross-cluster replication in 6.5.0 as a beta feature and it
is now mature enough that we make it generally available. Cross-cluster
replication enables you to replicate indices that exist in remote clusters to
your local cluster. You create an index in your local cluster (known as
a _follower index_) that follows an index (known as a _leader index_) in a
remote cluster. You can also automatically follow indices in a remote cluster
that match a pattern. The individual write operations that occur on the leader
indices are then replayed on the follower indices. This functionality is useful
for replicating data to a second cluster for disaster recovery purposes and for
geo-proximity so that reads can be served locally.

For more information, see {stack-ov}/xpack-ccr.html[Cross-cluster replication]
and <<ccr-apis>>.

=== Index lifecycle management

We have introduced index lifecycle management in 6.6.0 as a beta feature and it
is now mature enough that we make it generally available. The index lifecycle
management feature breaks the lifecycle of an index into four phases: hot,
warm, cold, and delete phase. You can define an index lifecycle policy which
enables you to:

* Have one primary shard on each hot node to maximize indexing throughput.
* Replace the hot index with a new empty index as soon as the existing index is “full” or after a time period. 
* Move the old index to warm nodes, where it can be shrunk to a single shard and force-merged down to a single segment for optimized storage and querying. 
* Later, move the index to cold nodes for cheaper storage.

=== {es-sql}

We have introduced {es-sql} in 6.3.0 as an experimental feature and it is now
mature enough that we make it generally available. This feature enables
users who are familiar with SQL to use SQL statements to query {es} indices.
In addition to querying through the SQL API, you can use the
<<sql-translate,Translate API>> to see how SQL queries are translated to
native {es} queries. There are four methods to access {es-sql}: through the
<<sql-rest, REST endpoints>>, the <<sql-cli,SQL command line interface>>, the
<<sql-jdbc,JDBC driver>>, and the <<sql-odbc,ODBC driver>>.


For more information, see <<xpack-sql, SQL Access>>.
