=== Breaking changes

Search::
* Scripts used in `value_count` will now receive a number if they are counting
  a numeric field and a `GeoPoint` if they are counting a `geo_point` fields.
  They used to always receive the `String` representation of those values.
  {pull}54854[#54854]

Features/Indices APIs::
*  Add auto create action that the bulk action redirects to when new indices
   need to be auto created. This means that action name `indices:admin/create`
   can no longer be used as privilege to allow auto creation of indices and
   instead `create_index` built in privilege should be used. {pull}55858[#55858]
