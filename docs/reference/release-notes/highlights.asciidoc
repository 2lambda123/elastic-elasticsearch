[[doc_values_only_search_supported_on_numeric_date_keyword_ip_boolean_types]]
=== Doc-values-only search is now supported on numeric, date, keyword, ip, and boolean types
Doc-value-only fields allow users to trade slower query performance for
an increased indexing rate and storage space efficiency. This is
achieved by disabling inverted structures such as the inverted index or
points, and using the columnar storage format of doc values to run
queries instead, while still providing the same usual great performance
for aggregating and sorting data. {es} {version} supports term and
range queries on `numeric`, `date`, `keyword`, `ip`, and `boolean`
doc-value-only field types.
