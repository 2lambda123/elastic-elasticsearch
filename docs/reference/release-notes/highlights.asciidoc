[[reading_indices_from_older_elasticsearch_versions]]
=== {es-pull}86261[Reading indices from older Elasticsearch versions]
Elasticsearch has full query and write support for indices created in the previous major
version. If you have indices created in Elasticsearch versions 5 or 6, you can now use
the archive functionality to import and query these indices as well.
The archive functionality provides slower read-only access to older data,
for compliance or regulatory reasons, the occasional lookback or investigation,
or to rehydrate parts of it. Access to the data is expected to be infrequent,
and can therefore happen with limited performance and query capabilities.

[[transforms_support_range_aggregation]]
=== {es-pull}86501[Transforms support range aggregation]
Now it is possible to use the range aggregations in {transforms}.
{transforms-cap} didnâ€™t support multi-bucket aggregations, but this
limitation no longer exists.

[[new_geo_grid_query]]
=== {es-pull}86596[New geo_grid query]
With the geo grid query, you can now natively return all the documents that overlap a specific geo tile.
There is no need to reconstruct the geometry or the actual boundaries of the spatial cluster as Elasticsearch
can do this for you, which saves you time and reduces complexity.
This is especially useful when geometries are spread across tiles like on a soccer ball or football.
While hexagon tiles line the sphere, calculating the boundary of each tile is not straightforward.

```
GET /example/_search
{
  "query": {
    "geo_grid" :{
      "location" : {
        "geotile" : "6/32/22"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Geo grid query can also help determine the single source of truth of containment.
With geo grid query, you can match exactly the intersection-test of Elasticsearch.
As an example, if a client has bounds for a grid-cell at a higher (or lower) precision than what is used
by Elasticsearch when running a corresponding aggregation, the containment-check might be slightly different.
This side-steps any disconnect based on projection/datum difference between client and Elasticsearch.
