[[cross-cluster-eql-search]]
=== Cross-cluster EQL search

In 7.14, we added cross-cluster search support to EQL. Cross-cluster search lets
you run an EQL search across one or more remote clusters. See
{ref}/eql.html#run-eql-search-across-clusters[Run an EQL search across
clusters].

[discrete]
[[async-sql-search]]
=== Async SQL search

We've added support for async searches to {es-sql}. Searches across large data
sets or frozen data can take longer to return synchronous results. Async SQL
search lets you run these searches in the background instead. See
{ref}/sql-async.html[Run an async SQL search].

[[transform-top-metrics-support]]
=== Transforms: support for top metrics

{transforms-cap} are now able to support the
{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-top-metrics.html[top metrics aggregation].
This improves performance when grouping by many fields. If these fields are
descriptive and have the same cardinality (for example, customer first and last
name describe their customer_id), then using top metrics significantly reduces
the work needed to be done by aggregations. It is also a usability improvement
if configuring top or last value, which previously would have required a
scripted metric.

[[ml-anomaly-detection-reset-job]]
=== {anomaly-detect-cap}: reset job API

The {ref}/ml-reset-job.html[reset job API] makes it easier to start
{anomaly-jobs} again from scratch, to put a job back to the state it was in
immediately after creation â€“ equivalent to deleting it and recreating it, but
without the need to remember the configuration. It also simplifies support, as
users will be able to reset their job by a single click.

[discrete]
[[match-only-text]]
=== New `match_only_text` field type

{ref}/text.html#match-only-text-field-type[`match_only_text`] is a new
space-optimized variant of `text` that disables scoring and performs slower
on queries that need positions. It is best suited for indexing log messages.

[discrete]
[[composite-aggs-without-global-ordinals]]
=== More memory-efficient composite aggregations

Composite aggregations on `keyword` fields no longer use
{ref}/eager-global-ordinals.html[global ordinals], which for high cardinality
fields could use a lot of heap memory as part of the
{ref}/modules-fielddata.html[field data cache].

[discrete]
[[new-migrate-data-tiers-routing-api]]
=== New migrate to data tiers routing API

7.14 introduces the {ref}/ilm-migrate-to-data-tiers.html[migrate to data tiers
routing API]. You can use the API to switch indices and ILM policies that use
attribute-based allocation filters to data tiers. This lets ILM automatically
move data stream indices between tiers during phase transitions. Data tiers also
give you access to additional ILM features, such as partially mounted indices
and the frozen tier.

[discrete]
[[new-terms-enum-api]]
=== New terms enum API

The new {ref}/search-terms-enum.html[terms enum API] lets you discover index
terms that match a partial string. You can use the API for search
auto-completion.
