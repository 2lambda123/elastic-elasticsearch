[[cross-cluster-eql-search]]
=== Cross-cluster EQL search

In 7.14, we added cross-cluster search support to EQL. Cross-cluster search lets
you run an EQL search across one or more remote clusters. See
{ref}/eql.html#run-eql-search-across-clusters[Run an EQL search across
clusters].

[[async-sql-search]]
=== Async SQL search

We've added support for async searches to {es-sql}. Searches across large data
sets or frozen data can take longer to return synchronous results. Async SQL
search lets you run these searches in the background instead. See
{ref}/sql-async.html[Run an async SQL search].

[[transform-top-metrics-support]]
=== Transforms: support for top metrics

{transforms-cap} are now able to support the 
{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-top-metrics.html[top metrics aggregation]. 
This improves performance when grouping by many fields. If these fields are 
descriptive and have the same cardinality (for example, customer first and last 
name describe their customer_id), then using top metrics significantly reduces 
the work needed to be done by aggregations. It is also a usability improvement 
if configuring top or last value, which previously would have required a 
scripted metric.

[[ml-anomaly-detection-reset-job]]
=== {anomaly-detect-cap}: reset job API

The {ref}/ml-reset-job.html[reset job API] makes it easier to start 
{anomaly-jobs} again from scratch, to put a job back to the state it was in 
immediately after creation â€“ equivalent to deleting it and recreating it, but 
without the need to remember the configuration. It also simplifies support, as 
users will be able to reset their job by a single click.
