=== Security features are enabled and configured by default

Running {es} without security leaves your cluster exposed to anyone who can send
network traffic to {es}. In previous versions, you had to explicitly enable the {es}
security features such as authantication, authorization and network encryption (TLS).

Starting in {es} 8.0, security is
{ref}/configuring-stack-security.html[enabled and configured by default] when
you start {es} for the first time. We also generate an enrollment token at
startup for {kib} so that you can quickly and easily connect a {kib} instance to your
secured {es} cluster without having to generate security certificates or update
`yml` configuration files. Just by starting {es}, youâ€™ll have password
protection, internode communication secured with TLS, and encrypted connections
between {es} and {kib}.

We're also shipping the
{ref}/create-enrollment-token.html[`elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token`] tool,
which you can use to generate enrollment tokens to enroll new {es} nodes with an
existing cluster, or configure {kib} instances to communicate with an existing
{es} cluster that has security features enabled. Just pass the enrollment token
when starting new nodes and {es} handles all of the security configuration for
you.

=== Storage savings for `keyword`, `match_only_text`, and `text` fields

We've updated inverted indices, an internal data structure, to use a more
space-efficient encoding. This change will benefit `keyword` fields,
`match_only_text` fields, and, to a lesser extent, `text` fields. In our
benchmarks using application logs, this translated into a 14.4% reduction of
the size of the index of the `message` field (mapped as `match_only_text`) and
an overall 3.5% reduction of the on-disk footprint.

This change will be picked up automatically by both new indices, and existing
indices for every new segment.

=== Faster indexing of `geo_point`, `geo_shape`, and range fields

We've optimized indexing speeds for multi-dimensional points, an internal data
structure used for `geo_point`, `geo_shape`, and range fields. Lucene-level
benchmarks reported 10-15% faster indexing for these fields types. {es} indices
and data streams that mostly consist of these fields may see noticeable
improvements to indexing speed.
