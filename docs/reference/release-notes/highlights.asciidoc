== What's new in {minor-version}

Here are the highlights of what's new and improved in {es} {minor-version}!

=== Security features are enabled and configured by default

Running {es} without security leaves your cluster exposed to anyone who can send
network traffic to {es}. In previous versions, you had to explicitly enable the 
{es} security features such as authentication, authorization, and network
encryption (TLS). Starting in {es} 8.0, security is
{ref}/configuring-stack-security.html[enabled and configured by default] when
you start {es} for the first time. 

At startup, we generate enrollment tokens that you use to connect a {kib} 
instance or enroll additional nodes in your secured {es} cluster, without having 
to generate security certificates or update YAML configuration files. Just use 
the generated enrollment token when starting new nodes or {kib} instances, and 
the {stack} handles all of the security configuration for you. Out of the box, 
you'll get:

* User authentication
* User authorization
* Encrypted internode communication with TLS
* Encrypted communication between {es} and {kib} with TLS

Need a new enrollment token? Use the 
{ref}/create-enrollment-token.html[`elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token`] 
tool to create enrollment tokens for {es} nodes and {kib} instances.

=== Storage savings for `keyword`, `match_only_text`, and `text` fields

We've updated inverted indices, an internal data structure, to use a more
space-efficient encoding. This change will benefit `keyword` fields,
`match_only_text` fields, and, to a lesser extent, `text` fields. In our
benchmarks using application logs, this translated into a 14.4% reduction of
the size of the index of the `message` field (mapped as `match_only_text`) and
an overall 3.5% reduction of the on-disk footprint.

This change will be picked up automatically by both new indices, and existing
indices for every new segment.

=== Faster indexing of `geo_point`, `geo_shape`, and range fields

We've optimized indexing speeds for multi-dimensional points, an internal data
structure used for `geo_point`, `geo_shape`, and range fields. Lucene-level
benchmarks reported 10-15% faster indexing for these fields types. {es} indices
and data streams that mostly consist of these fields may see noticeable
improvements to indexing speed.
