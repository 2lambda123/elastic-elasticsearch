=== Frozen tier is now GA

The frozen tier and partially mounted indices (partial searchable
snapshots) that were introduced as a technical preview feature in 7.12 are
now generally available.

See the
{ref}/release-highlights.html#frozen-tier-shared-snapshot-cache[original
announcement for 7.12] for more information.

=== Allow fields calculated by scripting at index time

Runtime fields allow you to create a synthetic field derived from the
values of other document properties at query time, which prioritises
flexibility (you can change these fields at any time) over speed. In
{minor-version} you can now generate these synthetic fields at index time,
trading off some of that flexibility for better query performance.

Scripted mappings are supported on the following field types by defining
the `script` field in the mappings: `long`, `double`, `keyword`,
`geo_point`, `ip`, `date`, and `boolean`.
