=== EQL: `with runs` statements for repeated events

In 7.16, we added the `with runs` statement syntax to EQL sequence queries.
Sometimes you want to find a sequence that contains an event multiple times in
succession. Rather than type the same event criteria multiple times, you can use
a `with runs` statement to declare the criteria once and run it successively.
For more details, check out the
{ref}/eql-syntax.html#eql-with-runs-statement[EQL syntax documentation].
