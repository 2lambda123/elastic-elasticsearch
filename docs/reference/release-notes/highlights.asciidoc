== What's new in {minor-version}

Here are the highlights of what's new and improved in {es} {minor-version}!

[discrete]
=== Faster indexing and searches on indexed `dense_vector` fields

We've done several optimizations for indexing and searches on high-dimensional
vectors (e.g. making HNSW graph hierarchical, speeding up graph merges,
reusing data structures, better encoding of doc Ids). Lucene-level benchmarks
reported up to 30% improvement in index throughput and 10% faster nearest
neighbor searches on these fields. {es} indices that use indexed `dense_vector`
fields should see these improvements.

[discrete]
===  Faster "count" searches for Points

Counting a number of documents that fall into a certain range could be faster now.
In {es} we use counting in aggregations (e.g. date range aggregation) and
for `_count` API.

[discrete]
=== Faster Terms Set query

We've optimized a Terms Set query for the case when the minimum number of
matching clauses is constant  across all documents. In this case, we enable
WAND (Weak AND) optimization to skip over non-competitive documents.
