[[stack_monitoring_logstash_load_average_type_fixed_for_metricbeat_collection]]
=== Stack Monitoring: Logstash load average type fixed for metricbeat collection
Previously, the templates for ingesting logstash load average using metricbeat were set to `long`. This provides only an integer graph.

The type has been corrected to `half_float`. You can force a rollover to see the change immediately or wait for the next ILM rollover.
