Synonyms APIs let you create and manage synonyms sets.

Synonyms sets can be used to configure <<analysis-synonym-graph-tokenfilter,synonym graph token filters>> and <<analysis-synonym-tokenfilter,synonym token filters>>.

Once a synonyms set is used in a synonym token filter, these token filters are used as part of a <<search-analyzer,search analyzers>>.
You can dynamically change the synonyms used at search time using these APIs to update the synonyms sets.
Your search results will immediately reflect the synonyms set change.

The following APIs can be used to manage synonyms sets:

* <<put-synonyms-set>>
* <<get-synonyms-set>>
* <<list-synonyms-sets>>
* <<delete-synonyms-set>>
