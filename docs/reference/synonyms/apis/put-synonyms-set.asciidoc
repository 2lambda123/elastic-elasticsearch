[[put-synonyms-set-example]]
==== {api-examples-title}

The following example creates a new Synonyms Set called `my-synonyms-set`:

[source,console]
----
PUT _synonyms/my-synonyms-set
{
  "synonyms_set": [
    {
      "id": "test-1",
      "synonyms": "hello, hi"
    },
    {
      "synonyms": "bye, goodbye"
    },
    {
      "id": "test-2",
      "synonyms": "test => check"
    }
  ]
}
----
// TEST[skip:TBD]

If any of the synonym rules included is not valid, the API will return an error.

[source,console]
----
PUT _synonyms/my-synonyms-set
{
  "synonyms_set": [
    {
      "synonyms": "hello => hi => howdy"
    }
  ]
}
----
// TEST[skip:TBD]

[source,console-result]
----
{
  "error": {
    "root_cause": [
      {
        "type": "action_request_validation_exception",
        "reason": "Validation Failed: 1: More than one explicit mapping specified in the same synonyms rule: [hello => hi => howdy];"
      }
    ],
    "type": "action_request_validation_exception",
    "reason": "Validation Failed: 1: More than one explicit mapping specified in the same synonyms rule: [hello => hi => howdy];"
  },
  "status": 400
}
----
// TEST[skip:TBD]

==== Analyzer reloading
When an existing synonyms set is updated, the <<search-analyzer, search analyzers>> that use the synonyms set are reloaded automatically for all indices.
This would be equivalent to invoking <<indices-reload-analyzers>> for all indices that use the synonyms set.

The reloading result is included as part of the response:

[source,console-result]
----
{
  "result": "updated",
  "reload_analyzers_details": {
    "_shards": {
      "total": 12,
      "successful": 10,
      "failed": 0
    },
    "reload_details": [
      {
        "index": "my-index",
        "reloaded_analyzers": [
          "my_search_analyzer"
        ],
        "reloaded_node_ids": [
          "1wYFZzq8Sxeu_Jvt9mlbkg"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
