Elasticsearch is a complex piece of software, with many moving parts. There are
many APIs, features, and settings designed to help you manage your
Elasticsearch cluster.

== Cluster setting types
There are two types of cluster settings:

// tag::setting-types[]

Static::

These settings must be set at the node level, either in the
`elasticsearch.yml` file, or as an environment variable or on the command line
when starting a node. They must be set on every relevant node in the cluster.


Dynamic::

These settings can be dynamically updated on a live cluster with the
<<cluster-update-settings,cluster-update-settings>> API.

// end::setting-types[]
