=== Description

This command resets the password of the `elastic` superuser. By default, a
strong password is generated for you. If you wish to choose the password, you
can run the tool in interactive mode with `-i`, where you will be prompted to
enter the desired password. It uses a temporary superuser in the
<<file-realm, file realm>> that is automatically generated and then removed,
in order to submit the request to change the `elastic` user password.

This command uses an HTTP connection to connect to the cluster and run the user
management requests. The command automatically attempts to establish the connection
over HTTPS by using the `xpack.security.http.ssl` settings in
the `elasticsearch.yml` file. If you do not use the default config directory
location, ensure that the *ES_PATH_CONF* environment variable returns the
correct path before you run the `elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token` command. You can
override settings in your `elasticsearch.yml` file by using the `-E` command
option. For more information about debugging connection failures, see
<<trb-security-setup>>.
