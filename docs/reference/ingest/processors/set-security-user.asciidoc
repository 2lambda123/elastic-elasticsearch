=== Set Security User Processor
Sets user-related details (such as `username`,  `roles`, `email`, `full_name`,
`metadata`, `api_key`, `realm` and `authentication_type`) from the current
authenticated user to the current document by pre-processing the ingest.
The `api_key` property is only applicable when the authentication is
through API key. It is an object containing two fields, `id` and `name`.
When using API key authentication, the `realm` property refers to the realm
from which the API key is created. It is also an object with two fields,
`name` and `type`.

IMPORTANT: Requires an authenticated user for the index request.
