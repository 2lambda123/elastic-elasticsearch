=== {dfanalytics-cap} job resources

{dfanalytics-cap} resources relate to APIs such as <<put-dfanalytics>> and
<<get-dfanalytics>>.

[[ml-dfanalytics-properties]]	
==== {api-definitions-title}

`analysis`::
  (object) The type of analysis that is performed on the `source`. For example: 
  `outlier_detection` or `regression`. For more information, see 
  <<dfanalytics-types>>.
  
`analyzed_fields`::
  (object) You can specify both `includes` and/or `excludes` patterns. If 
  `analyzed_fields` is not set, only the relevant fields will be included. For 
  example all the numeric fields for {oldetection}.
  
  `analyzed_fields.includes`:::
    (array) An array of strings that defines the fields that will be included in 
    the analysis.
    
  `analyzed_fields.excludes`:::
    (array) An array of strings that defines the fields that will be excluded 
    from the analysis.

`description`::
  (Optional, string) A description of the job.

`dest`::
  (object) The destination configuration of the analysis.
  
  `index`:::
    (Required, string) Defines the _destination index_ to store the results of 
    the {dfanalytics-job}.
  
  `results_field`:::
    (Optional, string) Defines the name of the field in which to store the 
    results of the analysis. Default to `ml`.

`id`::
  (string) The unique identifier for the {dfanalytics-job}. This identifier can 
  contain lowercase alphanumeric characters (a-z and 0-9), hyphens, and 
  underscores. It must start and end with alphanumeric characters. This property 
  is informational; you cannot change the identifier for existing jobs.
  
`model_memory_limit`::
  (string) The approximate maximum amount of memory resources that are 
  permitted for analytical processing. The default value for {dfanalytics-jobs} 
  is `1gb`. If your `elasticsearch.yml` file contains an 
  `xpack.ml.max_model_memory_limit` setting, an error occurs when you try to 
  create {dfanalytics-jobs} that have `model_memory_limit` values greater than 
  that setting. For more information, see <<ml-settings>>.

`source`::
  (object) The source configuration consisting an `index` and optionally a 
  `query` object.
  
  `index`:::
    (Required, string or array) Index or indices on which to perform the 
    analysis. It can be a single index or index pattern as well as an array of 
    indices or patterns.
    
  `query`:::
    (Optional, object) The {es} query domain-specific language 
    (<<query-dsl,DSL>>). This value corresponds to the query object in an {es} 
    search POST body. All the options that are supported by {es} can be used, 
    as this object is passed verbatim to {es}. By default, this property has 
    the following value: `{"match_all": {}}`.

[[dfanalytics-types]]
==== Analysis objects

{dfanalytics-cap} resources contain `analysis` objects. For example, when you
create a {dfanalytics-job}, you must define the type of analysis it performs.

[discrete]
[[oldetection-resources]]
==== {oldetection-cap} configuration objects 

An `outlier_detection` configuration object has the following properties:

`n_neighbors`::
  (integer) Defines the value for how many nearest neighbors each method of 
  {oldetection} will use to calculate its {olscore}. When the value is 
  not set, the system will dynamically detect an appropriate value.

`method`::
  (string) Sets the method that {oldetection} uses. If the method is not set 
  {oldetection} uses an ensemble of different methods and normalises and 
  combines their individual {olscores} to obtain the overall {olscore}. We 
  recommend to use the ensemble method. Available methods are `lof`, `ldof`, 
  `distance_kth_nn`, `distance_knn`.

`feature_influence_threshold`:: 
  (double) The minimum {olscore} that a document needs to have in order to 
  calculate its {fiscore}. 
  Value range: 0-1 (`0.1` by default).
  

[discrete]
[[regression-resources]]
==== {regression-cap} configuration objects

A `{regression}` configuration object has the following properties:

`dependent_variable`::
  (Required, string) Defines which field of the {dataframe} is to be predicted. 
  The data type of the field must be numeric.

`eta`::
  (Optional, double) The shrinkage applied to the weights. 

`feature_bag_fraction`::
  (Optional, double) Defines the fraction of features which will be used when 
  selecting a random bag for each candidate split. 

`gamma`::
  (Optional, double) A regularization parameter associated with tree training. 
  Defines a linear penalty associated with tree size. A higher value means 
  training will prefer smaller trees. It aims to prevent overfitting.
  
`lambda`::
  (Optional, double) A regularization parameters associated with tree training. 
  It is the L2 regularisation term which applies to leaf weights of the 
  individual trees in the forest. It aims to prevent overfitting.
  
`maximum_number_trees`::
  (Optional, integer) Defines the maximum number of trees the forest will be 
  allowed to contain. The maximum value is 2000.
  
`prediction_field_name`::
  (Optional, string) Defines the name of the prediction field in the results. 
  Defaults to `<dependent_variable>_prediction`.
  
`training_percent`::
  (Optional, integer) Defines what percentage of data frame rows that are 
  eligible for training are actually going to be used for training. Defaults to 
  `100`.

  (boolean) If `true`, the row was used for training the {regression} model.
