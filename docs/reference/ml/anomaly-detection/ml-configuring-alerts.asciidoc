= Configuring {anomaly-detect} alerts

{anomaly-detect-cap} alerts run scheduled checks on an {anomaly-job} or a group 
of jobs to detect anomalies with certain conditions. If an {anomaly} meets the 
conditions, the alert triggers the defined action. For example, you can create 
an alert that checks an {anomaly-job} in every fifteen minutes for critical 
anomalies and notify you in an email if it finds one. This page helps you to 
configure an {anomaly-detect} alert. To learn more about alerts in the {stack}, 
refer to 
{kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-getting-started[Alerting and Actions].

{anomaly-detect-cap} alerts can be created in the {anomaly-job} wizard or under 
**Stack management > Alerts and Actions**. On the *Create alert* template, 
select *{anomaly-detect-cap} alert* under the {ml-cap} section, then give a name 
to the alert and optionally provide tags.

// SCREENSHOT

Specify the time interval for the alert to check detected anomalies. It is 
recommended to select an interval that is similar to the bucket span of the 
associated job. You can also select a notification method by using the _Notify_ 
selector. There are three notification options:

* Notify only on status change: actions are triggered when the alert status 
  changes.
* Notify every time alert is active: actions are triggered every time when the 
  alert checks changes.
* Notify on a custom action interval: actions run by using an interval that you 
  configured.
  
Select the {anomaly-job} or the group of {anomaly-jobs} that is checked by the 
alert. In case you select a group, the {anomaly-detect} alert handles possible 
duplications in the results, hence they don't trigger the configured actions 
unnecessarily. Furthermore, if you assign additional jobs to this group, the 
alert automatically check the new jobs the next time when it runs.
