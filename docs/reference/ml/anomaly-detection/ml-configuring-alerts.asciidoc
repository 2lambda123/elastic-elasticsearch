= Configuring {anomaly-detect} alerts

You can optionally create alerts to receive notifications when an anomaly that 
meets the conditions you defined is detected. This page helps you to configure 
an {anomaly-detect} alert. To learn more about alerts in the {stack}, refer to 
{kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-getting-started[Alerting and Actions].

{anomaly-detect-cap} alerts can be created either in the {anomaly-job} wizard or 
under **Stack management > Alerts and Actions**. On the *Create alert* template, 
select *{anomaly-detect-cap} alert* under the {ml-cap} section, then give a name 
to the alert and optionally provide tags.

// SCREENSHOT

You can specify the time interval for the alert to check for detected anomalies. 
It is recommended to select an interval that is similar to the bucket span of 
the job that is associated with the alert.
