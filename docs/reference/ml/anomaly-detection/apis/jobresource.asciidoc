=== Job resources

A job resource has the following properties:

[[ml-analysisconfig]]`analysis_config`::
(object)
include::{docdir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=analysis-config]

`analysis_limits`::

(time units)
include::{docdir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=background-persist-interval]

`create_time`::
  (string) The time the job was created. For example, `1491007356077`. This
  property is informational; you cannot change its value.

  (string) If the job closed or failed, this is the time the job finished,
  otherwise it is `null`. This property is informational; you cannot change its
  value.

`groups`::
(array of strings)
include::{docdir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=groups]

`job_id`::
(string)
include::{docdir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=job-id-anomaly-detection-define]
This property is informational; you cannot change the identifier for existing
jobs.

`job_type`::
  (string) Reserved for future use, currently set to `anomaly_detector`.

`job_version`::
 (string) The version of {es} that existed on the node when the job was created.

`model_plot_config`::
(object)
include::{docdir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=model-plot-config]

`allow_lazy_open`::
(boolean)
include::{docdir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=allow-lazy-open]

[float]
[[ml-datadescription]]
==== Data description objects

The data description defines the format of the input data when you send data to
the job by using the <<ml-post-data,post data>> API. Note that when configure
a {dfeed}, these properties are automatically set.

When data is received via the <<ml-post-data,post data>> API, it is not stored
in {es}. Only the results for anomaly detection are retained.

A data description object has the following properties:

`format`::
  (string) Only `JSON` format is supported at this time.

`time_field`::
  (string) The name of the field that contains the timestamp.
  The default value is `time`.

`time_format`::
(string)
include::{docdir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=time-format]

[float]
[[ml-categorizationanalyzer]]
==== Categorization analyzer

The categorization analyzer specifies how the `categorization_field` is
interpreted by the categorization process. The syntax is very similar to that
used to define the `analyzer` in the <<indices-analyze,Analyze endpoint>>.

The `categorization_analyzer` field can be specified either as a string or as
an object.

If it is a string it must refer to a <<analysis-analyzers,built-in analyzer>> or
one added by another plugin.

If it is an object it has the following properties:

`char_filter`::
(array of strings or objects)
include::{docdir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=char-filter]

`tokenizer`::
(string or object)
include::{docdir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=tokenizer]

`filter`::
(array of strings or objects)
include::{docdir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=filter]

If you omit the `categorization_analyzer`, the following default values are used:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _ml/anomaly_detectors/_validate
{
  "analysis_config" : {
    "categorization_analyzer" : {
      "tokenizer" : "ml_classic",
      "filter" : [
        { "type" : "stop", "stopwords": [
          "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday",
          "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun",
          "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December",
          "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec",
          "GMT", "UTC"
        ] }
      ]
    },
    "categorization_field_name": "message",
    "detectors" :[{
      "function":"count",
      "by_field_name": "mlcategory"
    }]
  },
  "data_description" : {
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

If you specify any part of the `categorization_analyzer`, however, any omitted
sub-properties are _not_ set to default values.

If you are categorizing non-English messages in a language where words are
separated by spaces, you might get better results if you change the day or month
words in the stop token filter to the appropriate words in your language. If you
are categorizing messages in a language where words are not separated by spaces,
you must use a different tokenizer as well in order to get sensible
categorization results.

It is important to be aware that analyzing for categorization of machine
generated log messages is a little different from tokenizing for search.
Features that work well for search, such as stemming, synonym substitution, and
lowercasing are likely to make the results of categorization worse. However, in
order for drill down from {ml} results to work correctly, the tokens that the
categorization analyzer produces must be similar to those produced by the search
analyzer. If they are sufficiently similar, when you search for the tokens that
the categorization analyzer produces then you find the original document that
the categorization field value came from.

{stack-ov}/ml-configuring-categories.html[Categorizing log messages].

[[ml-detector-custom-rule]]
==== Detector Custom Rule

{stack-ov}/ml-rules.html[Custom rules] enable you to customize the way detectors 
operate. 

A custom rule has the following properties:

`actions`::
  (array) The set of actions to be triggered when the rule applies.
  If more than one action is specified the effects of all actions are combined.
  The available actions include: +
  `skip_result`::: The result will not be created. This is the default value.
  Unless you also specify `skip_model_update`, the model will be updated as
  usual with the corresponding series value.
  `skip_model_update`::: The value for that series will not be used to update
  the model. Unless you also specify `skip_result`, the results will be created
  as usual. This action is suitable when certain values are expected to be
  consistently anomalous and they affect the model in a way that negatively
  impacts the rest of the results.
  
`scope`::
  (object) An optional scope of series where the rule applies. By default, the 
  scope includes all series. Scoping is allowed for any of the fields that are 
  also specified in `by_field_name`, `over_field_name`, or `partition_field_name`.
  To add a scope for a field, add the field name as a key in the scope object and
  set its value to an object with the following properties:  
`filter_id`:::
  (string) The id of the filter to be used.

`filter_type`:::
  (string) Either `include` (the rule applies for values in the filter)
  or `exclude` (the rule applies for values not in the filter). Defaults
  to `include`.    

`conditions`::
  (array) An optional array of numeric conditions when the rule applies.
  Multiple conditions are combined together with a logical `AND`.
+
--
NOTE: If your detector uses `lat_long`, `metric`, `rare`, or `freq_rare` 
functions, you can only specify `conditions` that apply to `time`.

  
A condition has the following properties: 

`applies_to`:::
    (string) Specifies the result property to which the condition applies.
    The available options are `actual`, `typical`, `diff_from_typical`, `time`.
`operator`:::
    (string) Specifies the condition operator. The available options are
    `gt` (greater than), `gte` (greater than or equals), `lt` (less than) and `lte` (less than or equals).
`value`:::
    (double) The value that is compared against the `applies_to` field using the `operator`.
--

A rule is required to either have a non-empty scope or at least one condition.
For more examples see 
{stack-ov}/ml-configuring-detector-custom-rules.html[Configuring Detector Custom Rules].

[[ml-apilimits]]
==== Analysis limits

Limits can be applied for the resources required to hold the mathematical models in memory.
These limits are approximate and can be set per job. They do not control the
memory used by other processes, for example the Elasticsearch Java processes.
If necessary, you can increase the limits after the job is created.

The `analysis_limits` object has the following properties:

`categorization_examples_limit`::
  (long) The maximum number of examples stored per category in memory and
  in the results data store. The default value is 4.  If you increase this value,
  more examples are available, however it requires that you have more storage available.
  If you set this value to `0`, no examples are stored. +
+
--
NOTE: The `categorization_examples_limit` only applies to analysis that uses categorization.
For more information, see
{stack-ov}/ml-configuring-categories.html[Categorizing log messages].

--

`model_memory_limit`::
  (long or string) The approximate maximum amount of memory resources that are
  required for analytical processing. Once this limit is approached, data pruning
  becomes more aggressive. Upon exceeding this limit, new entities are not
  modeled. The default value for jobs created in version 6.1 and later is `1024mb`.
  This value will need to be increased for jobs that are expected to analyze high
  cardinality fields, but the default is set to a relatively small size to ensure
  that high resource usage is a conscious decision. The default value for jobs
  created in versions earlier than 6.1 is `4096mb`.
+
--
If you specify a number instead of a string, the units are assumed to be MiB.
Specifying a string is recommended for clarity. If you specify a byte size unit
of `b` or `kb` and the number does not equate to a discrete number of megabytes,
it is rounded down to the closest MiB. The minimum valid value is 1 MiB. If you
specify a value less than 1 MiB, an error occurs. For more information about
supported byte size units, see <<byte-units,Common options>>.

If your `elasticsearch.yml` file contains an `xpack.ml.max_model_memory_limit`
setting, an error occurs when you try to create jobs that have
`model_memory_limit` values greater than that setting. For more information,
see <<ml-settings>>.

[[ml-apimodelplotconfig]]
==== Model plot config

This advanced configuration option stores model information along with the
results. It provides a more detailed view into anomaly detection.

WARNING: If you enable model plot it can add considerable overhead to the performance
of the system; it is not feasible for jobs with many entities.

Model plot provides a simplified and indicative view of the model and its bounds.
It does not display complex features such as multivariate correlations or multimodal data.
As such, anomalies may occasionally be reported which cannot be seen in the model plot.

Model plot config can be configured when the job is created or updated later. It must be
disabled if performance issues are experienced.

The `model_plot_config` object has the following properties:

`enabled`::
  (boolean) If true, enables calculation and storage of the model bounds for
  each entity that is being analyzed. By default, this is not enabled.

`terms`::
  experimental[] (string) Limits data collection to this comma separated list of 
  partition or by field values. If terms are not specified or it is an empty 
  string, no filtering is applied. For example, "CPU,NetworkIn,DiskWrites". 
  Wildcards are not supported. Only the specified `terms` can be viewed when 
  using the Single Metric Viewer.
