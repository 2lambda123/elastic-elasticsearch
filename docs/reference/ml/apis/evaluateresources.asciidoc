=== Evaluate {dfanalytics} resources

The evaluation object defines the type of evaluation you want to perform. An 
evaluation configuration object has the following properties:

`binary_soft_classification`::
  (object) Configures a binary soft classification type evaluation.

[[binary-sc-resources]]
==== Binary soft classification resources

A binary soft classification object has the following properties:

`actual_field` (Required)::
  (string) The field of the `index` which contains the `ground 
  truth`. The data type of this field can be boolean or integer. If the data 
  type is integer, the value has to be either `0` (false) or `1` (true).

`predicted_probability_field` (Required)::
  (string) The field of the `index` that defines the probability of whether the 
  item is an outlier or not. It is the field that contains the results of the 
  analysis.

`metrics` (Optional)::
  (object) Specifies the metrics that are used for the evaluation. Available 
  mertics:
  
  `auc_roc` (Optional)::
    (object) The AUC ROC score and optionally the curve.
    Default value is {"includes_curve": false}.
    
  `precision` (Optional)::
    (object) Set the different thresholds of the {olscore} at where the metric 
    is calculated.
    Default value is {"at": [0.25, 0.50, 0.75]}.
  
  `recall` (Optional)::
    (object) Set the different thresholds of the {olscore} at where the metric 
    is calculated.
    Default value is {"at": [0.25, 0.50, 0.75]}.
  
  `confusion_matrix` (Optional)::
    (object) Set the different thresholds of the {olscore} at where the metrics 
    (TP, FP, TN, FN) are calculated.
    Default value is {"at": [0.25, 0.50, 0.75]}.
