=== Delete Forecast API
++++
<titleabbrev>Delete Forecast</titleabbrev>
++++

Deletes forecasts from a {ml} job.  

==== Request

`DELETE _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>/_forecast` +

`DELETE _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>/_forecast/<forecast_id>` +

`DELETE _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>/_forecast/_all` 


==== Description

By default, forecasts are retained for 14 days. You can specify a different 
retention period with the `expires_in` parameter in the <<ml-forecast,forecast jobs API>>. The delete forecast API enables you to delete one or more forecasts before they expire.

NOTE: When you delete a job its associated forecasts are deleted. 

For more information, see {xpack-ref}/ml-overview.html#ml-forecasting[Forecasting the Future].


==== Path Parameters

`job_id` (required)::
  (string) Identifier for the job.

`forecast_id`::
  (string) A comma-separated list of forecast identifiers. 
//TBD: Can this ID be retrieved somehow?
  If you do not specify this optional parameter or if you specify `_all`, the 
  API deletes all forecasts from the job.  

==== Request Parameters

`allow_no_forecasts`::
  (boolean) Whether to ignore if `_all` matches no forecasts. 
//TBD: This description is unclear.  Does this mean that if this parameter is 
//false and there are no forecasts in the job, an error is returned?

`timeout`::
  (time units) Controls the time to wait until the forecasts are deleted. 
  Defaults to 30 seconds. For more information about time units, see <<time-units>>.
//TBD: This description is unclear.  Is it the time to wait until the deletion 
//is initiated?  Or is it the time to wait for the deletion to complete? If the
//latter, I presume an error is returned and you must try again.
