[[ml-dfanalytics-resources]]
=== {dfanalytics-cap} resources

A {dfanalytics} configuration object has the following properties:

`analysis`::
  (object) The type of analysis that is performed on the `source`. For example: 
  `outlier_detection`.

`dest`::
  (object) The destination configuration of the analysis, consisting of `index` 
  and optionally `results_field` (`ml` by default). 

`id`::
  (string) The unique identifier for the {dfanalytics-job}. This identifier can 
  contain lowercase alphanumeric characters (a-z and 0-9), hyphens, and 
  underscores. It must start and end with alphanumeric characters. This property 
  is informational; you cannot change the identifier for existing jobs.

`source`::
  (object) The source configuration, consisting of `index` and optionally a 
  `query`.

==== {oldetection-cap} Configuration Objects 

An {oldetection} configuration object has the following properties:

`n_neighbors` (Optional)::
  (integer) Defines the value for up to how many neighbors 
  {oldetection} should check in the index for a certain point to calculate its 
  {olscore}. When the value is not set, the system will dynamically detect an 
  appropriate value.

`method` (Optional)::
  (string) Sets the method that {oldetection} uses. If the method is 
  not set, the system assembles different models that use different methods, 
  then hierarchically combines the different models to find a solution that 
  applies to the dataset. Available methods are `lof`, `ldof`, `distance_kth_nn`, 
  `distance_knn`.

`feature_influence_threshold` (Optional):: 
  (double) The minimum {olscore} that a document needs to have in order to 
  calculate its {fiscore}. 
  Value range: 0-1 (`0.4` by default).
