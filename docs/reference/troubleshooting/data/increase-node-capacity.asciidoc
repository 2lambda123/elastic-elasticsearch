== Not enough nodes to place all shard replicas

Elasticsearch tries to keep copies of the data (index shard replicas) on different nodes so that
if one node fails the data is still available on another node. If the index has a preferred tier,
Elasticsearch will only try to place the copies of the data for that index on nodes in that tier.

Users might want to influence this behavior by adding more nodes to the cluster (or tier if tiers are
in use), or by configuring the
<<dynamic-index-number-of-replicas,`index.number_of_replicas`>>
index setting to reduce the number of replcas that need to be stored.

In order to fix this follow the next steps:
