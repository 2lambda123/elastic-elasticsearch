== Not enough nodes to place all shard replicas

Elasticsearch tries to keep copies of the data (index shard replicas) on different nodes to protect against
hardware failure and increase the capacity to serve requests like searching for documents. If the index has
a preferred tier, Elasticsearch will only try to place the copies of the data for that index on nodes in
the target tier.

Users might want to influence this behavior by adding more nodes to the cluster (or tier if tiers are
in use), or by reducing the
<<dynamic-index-number-of-replicas,`index.number_of_replicas`>> index setting.

In order to fix this follow the next steps:
