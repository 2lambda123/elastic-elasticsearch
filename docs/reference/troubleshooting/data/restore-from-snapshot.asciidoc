== Restore from snapshot

Elasticsearch is using snapshots to store a copy of your data outside a cluster. You can restore a snapshot to recover
indices and data streams for which there are no copies of the shards in the cluster. This can happen if the data (indices or data streams) was deleted or
hardware failure.

IMPORTANT: Restoring the missing data requires you to have a usable backup of the affected indices and data streams. Please do not
proceed without confirming this.

The following steps will guide you through this process.
