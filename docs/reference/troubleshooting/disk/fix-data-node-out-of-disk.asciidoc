== Fix data node out of disk

Elasticsearch is using data nodes to distribute your data inside the cluster. If one or more of these nodes are running
out of space, elasticsearch takes action to redistribute your data within the nodes so all nodes have enough available
disk space. If elasticsearch cannot create enough available space then you will need to intervene in one of two ways:

. <<increase-capacity-data-node, Increase the disk capacity of your cluster>>
. <<decrease-disk-usage-data-node, Reduce the disk usage by decreasing your data volume>>

[[increase-capacity-data-node]]
