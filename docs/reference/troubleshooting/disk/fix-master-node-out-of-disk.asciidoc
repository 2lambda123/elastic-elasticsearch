== Fix master nodes out of disk

Elasticsearch is using master nodes to coordinate the cluster. If one or more of these nodes are running
out of space, you need to ensure that they have enough disk space to function. If the health disk indicator
reports that your master node is out of space you need to increase the disk capacity of your master nodes.
