=== Diagnosing corrupted repositories

Multiple {es} deployments are writing to the same snapshot repository. {es} doesn't
support this configuration and only one cluster is allowed to write to the same
repository. See <<snapshot-repository-contents>> for potential side-effects of
corruption of the repository contents, which may not be resolved by the following
guide.
To remedy the situation mark the repository as read-only or remove it from all the
other deployments, and re-add (recreate) the repository in the current deployment:

[[diagnosing-unknown-repositories]]
=== Diagnosing unknown repositories

When a snapshot repository is marked as "unknown", it means that an {es} node is
unable to instantiate the repository due to an unknown repository type. This is
usually caused by a missing plugin on the node. Make sure each node in the cluster
has the required plugins.


[[diagnosing-invalid-repositories]]
=== Diagnosing invalid repositories

When an {es} node faces an unexpected exception when trying to instantiate a snapshot
repository, it will mark the repository as "invalid" and write a warning to the log file.
Please refer to the logs of the affected node(s) for more information on the exact
reason that caused the unexpected exception.
