=== Dissect patterns
Dissect matches a single text field against a defined pattern. A dissect
pattern is defined by the parts of the string you want to discard. Paying
special attention to the parts of the string you want to discard will help
build successful dissect patterns.

Regex is incredibly powerful but can be complicated. If you don't need the
power of regular expressions, use dissect patterns, which are simple and
often faster than grok patterns.
