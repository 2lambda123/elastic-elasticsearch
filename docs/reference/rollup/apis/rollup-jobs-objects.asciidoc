The <<rollup-get-rollup-caps,get rollup job capabilities API>> returns
`rollup_jobs`, which is an array of objects that provide information about the
capabilities of rollup jobs on specific indices or index patterns. For more
information, see <<xpack-rollup>>.

==== Properties

`cron`::
  (string) A cron string that defines when the rollup job runs. It defines an
  interval of when to run the job's indexer. When the interval triggers, the
  indexer attempts to roll up the data in the index pattern. The cron pattern is
  unrelated to the time interval of the data being rolled up. For example, you
  can create hourly rollups of your document (as defined in the
  <<rollup-groups-config,grouping configuration>>) but run the indexer only on a
  daily basis at midnight, as defined by the cron. The cron pattern is defined
  just like the {watcher} cron schedule.

`fields`::
  (object) A list of fields that contain data that is eligible for rollup
  searches.
  
`groups`::
  (object) A list of the grouping fields. 

`index_pattern`::
  (string) The index or index pattern that is rolled up. Supports wildcard-style
  patterns (for example, `logstash-*`).

--
[NOTE]
This property value cannot be a pattern that also matches the `rollup_index`.
For example, the pattern `"foo-*"` matches the rollup index `"foo-rollup"`. This
situation causes problems because the rollup job attempts to roll up its own
data at runtime. If you attempt to configure a pattern that matches the
`rollup_index`, an exception is thrown to prevent this behavior.

--

`job_id`::
  (string) The unique identifier for the data that is associated with the rollup
  job. It can be any alphanumeric string.

`metrics`::
  (object) The metrics to collect for each group.
  
`page_size`::
  (int) The number of bucket results that are processed on each iteration of the
  rollup indexer. A larger value tends to execute faster but requires more
  memory during processing. This property has no effect on how the data is
  rolled up; it is merely used for tweaking the speed or memory cost of the
  indexer.

`rollup_index`::
  (string) The index that contains rollup results. This index stores all the
  rollup data that is generated by the job. It can be shared by multiple rollup
  jobs.
