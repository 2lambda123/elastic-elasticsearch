The <<rollup-get-job,get rollup jobs API>> retrieves the following objects,
which provide information about the status and statistics for each job.

==== {api-definitions-title}

`status`:: (object) The current status of the rollup job's indexer.
  `job_state`::: (string) Valid values are:
+
--
* `stopped`: The indexer is paused and will not process data, even if its cron
interval triggers.
* `started`: The indexer is running, but not actively indexing data. When the
cron interval triggers, the job's indexer will begin to process data.
* `indexing`: The indexer is actively processing data and creating new rollup
documents. When in this state, any subsequent cron interval triggers will be
ignored because the job is already active with the prior trigger.
* `abort`: A transient state, which is usually not witnessed by the user. The
`abort` state is used if the task needs to be shut down for some reason. For
example, the job has been deleted or an unrecoverable error has been encountered.  Shortly after the `abort` state is set, the job will remove itself from the
cluster.
--

`stats`::
  (object) Transient statistics about the rollup job.
+
--
NOTE: These stats are not persisted. If a node is restarted, these stats are
reset.

  `documents_processed`:: The number of documents that have been processed. For
  example, `0`.

  For example, `0`.
  
  `trigger_count`:: TBD. `0`.
