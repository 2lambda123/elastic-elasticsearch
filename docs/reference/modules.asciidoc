This section contains modules responsible for various aspects of the functionality in Elasticsearch.  Each module has settings which may be:

include::{docdir}/administering.asciidoc[tag=setting-types]

The modules in this section are:

<<modules-gateway,Gateway>>::

    How many nodes need to join the cluster before recovery can start.

<<modules-http,HTTP>>::

    Settings to control the HTTP REST interface.

<<modules-indices,Indices>>::

    Global index-related settings.

<<modules-network,Network>>::

    Controls default network settings.

<<modules-node,Node client>>::

    A Java node client joins the cluster, but doesn't hold data or act as a master node.

<<modules-plugins,Plugins>>::

    Using plugins to extend Elasticsearch.

<<modules-snapshots,Snapshot/Restore>>::

    Backup your data with snapshot/restore.

<<modules-threadpool,Thread pools>>::

    Information about the dedicated thread pools used in Elasticsearch.

<<modules-transport,Transport>>::

    Configure the transport networking layer, used internally by Elasticsearch
    to communicate between nodes.

<<modules-remote-clusters, Remote clusters>>::

    Remote clusters are used in features that work by connecting across clusters
    on the transport layer.

<<modules-cross-cluster-search, {ccs-cap}>>::

    {ccs-cap} enables executing search requests across more than one cluster
    without joining them and acts as a federated client across them.
