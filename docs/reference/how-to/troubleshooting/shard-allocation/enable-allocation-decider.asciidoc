==== Enable allocation decider

[discrete]
===== Description
A shard targets a given tier (e.g. hot or cold), and all of the nodes that make up that tier respond that they
cannot allocate the shard because allocation is disabled for that shard.

[discrete]
===== Solution
Check the value of <<dynamic-index-settings, `index.routing.allocation.enable`>> and
<<dynamic-index-settings, `index.routing.rebalance.enable`>> for the index that
the shard belongs to, and update if needed. Check the value of <<cluster-shard-allocation-settings, `cluster.routing.allocation.enable`>>
and <<cluster-shard-allocation-settings, `cluster.routing.rebalance.enable`>>, and update if needed.
