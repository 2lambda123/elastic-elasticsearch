==== Primary or replica shards are unassigned.

[discrete]
===== Description
Allocation of shards has been disabled by configuration. This can be configured at the index level or cluster-wide. Only primaries, only
replicas, or both primaries and replicas can be disabled. Some indices have unassigned shards because allocation has been disabled.

===== Solution

. Check the value of the <<dynamic-index-settings, `index.routing.allocation.enable`>> setting for the index that the shard belongs to. If
the setting does not exist, move to the next step. If the setting exists and has some value other than `all`, remove the setting (the
default is `all`).
. Check the value of the <<cluster-shard-allocation-settings, `cluster.routing.allocation.enable`>> cluster setting. If the setting exists
and has some value other than `all`, remove the setting (the default is `all`).
