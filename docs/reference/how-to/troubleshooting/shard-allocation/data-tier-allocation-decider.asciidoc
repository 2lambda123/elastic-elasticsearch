[[data-tier-allocation-decider]]

[discrete]
==== Primary or replica shards are unassigned.

[discrete]
===== Description
A shard cannot be allocated on any node based on the _tier_preference settings of the index and the data node roles configured for the
target node.

[discrete]
===== Solution
This often happens because of a mixture of using the _tier_preference setting based on node roles, and the index allocation settings
based on custom node attributes (e.g. require.data: warm). The best option is to <<migrate-index-allocation-filters, switch to using only
node roles>> instead.
