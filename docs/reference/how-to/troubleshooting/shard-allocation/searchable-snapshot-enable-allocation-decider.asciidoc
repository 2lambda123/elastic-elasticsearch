==== Searchable snapshot enable allocation decider

[discrete]
===== Description
After a <<restart-cluster-rolling, rolling restart>> the <<cluster-shard-allocation-settings, `cluster.routing.allocation.enable`>> setting
did not get changed from `primaries` back to `all`, and `cluster.routing.allocation.enable` is `false` (the default value). The cluster will
 not allocate any replica shards.

[discrete]
===== Solution
If the rolling restart is complete, set `cluster.routing.allocation.enable` to `all`.
