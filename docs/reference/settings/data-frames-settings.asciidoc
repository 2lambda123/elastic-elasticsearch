=== Data frames settings in Elasticsearch
++++
<titleabbrev>{dataframe-transforms} settings</titleabbrev>
++++

You do not need to configure any settings to use {dataframe-transforms}. It is enabled by default.

All of these settings can be added to the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. 
The dynamic settings can also be updated across a cluster with the 
<<cluster-update-settings,cluster update settings API>>.

TIP: Dynamic settings take precedence over settings in the `elasticsearch.yml` 
file.

==== General {dataframe-transforms} settings

`xpack.data_frames.num_transform_failure_retries`::
The number of times that a {dataframe-transform} retries when it experiences a
non-fatal error. Once the number of retries is exhausted, the {dataframe-transform}
task will be marked as `failed`. The default value is `10` with a valid minimum of `0`
and maximum of `100`.
If a {dataframe-transform} is already running, it will have to be restarted
to use the changed setting.
