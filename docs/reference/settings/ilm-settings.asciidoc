=== {ilm-cap} settings

These index-level {ilm-init} settings are typically configured through index
templates. For more information, see <<ilm-gs-create-policy>>.

`index.lifecycle.name`::
The name of the policy to use to manage the index.

`index.lifecycle.rollover_alias`::
The index alias to update when the index rolls over. Specify when using a
policy that contains a rollover action. When the index rolls over, the alias is
updated to reflect that the index is no longer the write index. For more
information about rollover, see <<using-policies-rollover>>.

`indices.lifecycle.poll_interval`::
(<<time-units, time units>>) How often {ilm} checks for indices that meet policy
criteria. Defaults to `10m`.

`index.lifecycle.parse_origination_date`::
When configured to `true` the origination date will be parsed from the index
name. The index format must match the pattern `^.*-{date_format}`, where the
`date_format` is `yyyy.MM.dd`. If the index name doesn't match the pattern, the
index creation date will be used to calculate the index age.

`index.lifecycle.origination_date`::
The timestamp that will be used to calculate the index age for its phase
transitions. This allows the users to create an index containing old data and
use the original creation date of the old data to calculate the index age.
