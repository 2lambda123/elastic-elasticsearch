These are the settings available for configuring <<data-lifecycle-management, {dlm}>> ({dlm-init}).

==== Cluster level settings

[[indices-dlm-poll-interval]]
`indices.dlm.poll_interval`::
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>, <<time-units, time unit value>>)
How often {dlm} checks what is the next action for all managed data streams. Defaults to `10m`.

[[cluster-dlm-default-rollover]]
`cluster.dlm.default.rollover`::
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>, string)
This property accepts a key value pair formatted string, for example `key1=value1,key2=value2` and configures the
conditions that would trigger a data stream to <<index-rollover,rollover>> when managed by <<data-lifecycle-management, {dlm}>>.
Defaults to `max_age=auto,max_primary_shard_size=50gb,min_docs=1,max_primary_shard_docs=200000000`, this means that your
data stream will rollover if any of the following conditions are met:

* Either any primary shard reaches the size of 50GB,
* or any primary shard contains 200.000.000 documents
* or the index reaches a certain age which depends on the retention time of your data stream,
* **and** has at least one document.
