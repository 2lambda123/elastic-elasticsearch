The following are the _expert-level_ settings available for configuring the
<<health-api, Health API>>. It is not recommended to change any of these
from their default values.

==== Cluster level settings

`health.master_history.has_master_lookup_timeframe`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>) The amount of time a node looks back to see if it has observed
a master at all, before moving on with other checks. Defaults to `30s` (30 seconds).

`master_history.max_age`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>) The maximum amount of time that the master history is kept in memory
for use in the Health API. Master node changes older than this time will not be considered in the Health
API calculation. Defaults to `30m` (30 minutes).

`health.master_history.identity_changes_threshold`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>) The number of times that it is not OK to have a master change identity
to another node. This many changes or more will be reported as a problem in the Health API. Defaults to `4`.

`health.master_history.no_master_transitions_threshold`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>) The number of times that it is not OK to have a master switch to no
master. This many transitions or more will be reported as a problem in the Health API. Defaults to `4`.
