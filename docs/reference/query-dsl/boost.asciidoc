[[query-dsl-boost]]
== `boost` parameter

You can use the `boost` parameter to adjust <<query-filter-context,relevance
scores>> for searches containing two or more queries.

The `boost` value is a floating point number used to decrease or increase the
relevance scores of documents returned by a query. The default value is `1.0`.

A value greater than `1.0` increases the relevance score, meaning those
documents higher in the search results. A boost value between `0` and `1.0`
decreases the relevance score of matching documents, meaning they appear lower
in the search results.

[WARNING]
====
{es} does **not** support negative `boost` values.

The following search returns documents matching "full text search." Documents
that also match "Elasticsearch" receive higher relevance scores, which means
they appear higher in the search results.

The following search returns documents matching "apple." Documents that also
match "pie" receive lower relevance scores, which means they appear lower in
the search results.
