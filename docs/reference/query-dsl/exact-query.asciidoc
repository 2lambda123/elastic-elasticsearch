=== Exact query
++++
<titleabbrev>Exact</titleabbrev>
++++

Returns documents that contain an exact value for a field.

For most field types, this behaves the same as a <<query-dsl-term-query, term query>>.  For
analyzed fields such as <<text-field-type, text>> however, it will only return documents where
the query value exactly matches the entire content of the field.

[[exact-query-ex-request]]
==== Example request

[source,console]
----
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "exact": {
      "text": "this is some text"
    }
  }
}
----

This will return documents that have precisely `this is some text` in their `text` field,
but it will not return documents with values of `some text`, `this is some text again`, or
`This is some Text`.

==== Notes

[[exact-query-notes-multivalued]]
===== Multi-valued fields

If a document has multiple values for a field, then `exact` will return if it matches
any one of those values.
