== Adding nodes to your cluster

An {es} _node_ is a single server that is part of your
cluster and stores pieces of your data called _shards_.

You can add more nodes to your cluster and optionally designate specific
purposes for each node. For example, you can allocate master nodes, data nodes,
ingest nodes, machine learning nodes, and dedicated coordinating nodes. For
details about each node type, see <<modules-node,Nodes>>.

In a single cluster, you can have as many nodes as you want but they must be
able to communicate with each other. The communication between nodes in a
cluster is handled by the <<modules-transport,transport module>>.

When you have multiple nodes, your data can be distributed across the cluster in
multiple primary and replica shards. For example:

For more information about the concepts of
clusters, nodes, and shards, see <<getting-started-concepts>>.

The method for adding nodes to your cluster varies depending on whether you are
in development or production mode, whether you are adding the new node on the
same server or a different server, and which {es} package you installed.

For more information, see <<modules-discovery-adding-removing-nodes>>.
