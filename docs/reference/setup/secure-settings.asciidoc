=== Secure Settings

Some settings are sensitive, and relying on filesystem permissions to protect
their values is not sufficient. For this use case, elasticsearch provides a
keystore, which may be password protected, and the
<<elasticsearch-keystore-command,`elasticsearch-keystore`>>
tool to manage the settings in the keystore.

NOTE: Only some settings are designed to be read from the keystore. See
documentation for each setting to see if it is supported as part of the keystore.
