==== Running Elasticsearch from the command line

Elasticsearch can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
.\bin\elasticsearch.bat
--------------------------------------------

If you have configured secure settings and password-protected the {es}
keystore, you will be prompted to enter the keystore's password. See
{ref}/secure-settings.html[secure settings] for more details.

By default, Elasticsearch runs in the foreground, prints its logs to `STDOUT`,
and can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl-C`.
