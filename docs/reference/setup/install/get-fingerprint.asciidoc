==== Connect clients to {es}

When you start {es} for the first time, it generates a hex-coded SHA-256
fingerprint of the generated HTTPS CA DER-encoded certificate in the terminal.
To connect your client to {es}, copy this fingerprint and pass it as a parameter.
Any clients that connect to {es}, such as the 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html[{es} Clients],
{beats}, {ls}, and {fleet} can verify that {es} is using a certificate that is signed
by the CA certificate that matches the fingerprint

If the auto-configuration process already completed, you can still obtain the 
fingerprint of the security certificate. You can also copy the CA certificate
to your machine and configure your client to use it.

===== Use the CA fingerprint

Run the following command to obtain the CA fingerprint. The path is to the
auto-generated CA certificate for the HTTP layer.

[source,sh]
----
openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256 -in config/tls_auto_config_<timestamp>/http_ca.crt
----

`<timestamp>`:: The timestamp of when the auto-configuration process created the security files directory.

The command returns the the security certificate, including the fingerprint.
The `issuer` should be `Elasticsearch security auto-configuration HTTP CA`.

[source,sh]
----
issuer= /CN=Elasticsearch security auto-configuration HTTP CA
SHA256 Fingerprint=<fingerprint>
----

===== Use the CA certificate

If your library doesn't support a method of validating the fingerprint, the 
auto-generated CA certificate is created in the
`config/tls_auto_config_<timestamp>` directory on each {es} node. Copy the
`http_ca.crt` file to your machine and configure your client to use this
certificate to establish trust when it connects to {es}.
