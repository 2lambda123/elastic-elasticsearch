==== Start {es} with security enabled

When starting {es} for the first time, security features are enabled and
configured by default. The following security configuration occurs
automatically: 

* Authentication and authorization are enabled, and a password is generated for
the `elastic` built-in superuser.
* Certificates and keys for TLS are generated for the transport and HTTP layer,
and TLS is enabled and configured with these keys and certificates.

The password and certificate and keys are output to your terminal. For example:

[source,sh]
----
The generated password for the elastic built-in superuser is:
H16Wd=K4dcmgZVA-GE2I

The enrollment token for Kibana instances, valid for the next 30 minutes:

You can complete the following actions at any time:
Reset the password of the elastic built-in superuser with
'bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic'.

Generate an enrollment token for Kibana instances with
'bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana'.

Generate an enrollment token for Elasticsearch nodes with
'bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node'.

===== Reconfigure a node to join an existing cluster

When you start {es} for the first time, the installation process configures a
single-node cluster by default. If you want a node to join an existing cluster
instead, generate an enrollment token on an existing node _before_ you start
the new node for the first time.

. On any node in your existing cluster, generate a node enrollment token:
+
[source, sh]
----
bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node
----

. Copy the enrollment token, which is output to your terminal.

. On your new {es} node, pass the enrollment token as a parameter to the 
`elasticsearch-reconfigure-node` tool:
+
[source, sh]
----
bin/elasticsearch-reconfigure-node --enrollment-token <enrollment-token>
----
+
{es} is now configured to join the existing cluster.

. Start your new node.
+
[source, sh]
----
bin/elasticsearch
