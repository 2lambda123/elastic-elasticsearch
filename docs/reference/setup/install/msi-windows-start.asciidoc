==== Running Elasticsearch from the command line

Once installed, Elasticsearch can be started from the command line, if not installed as a service
and configured to start when installation completes, as follows:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
--------------------------------------------
.\bin\elasticsearch.exe
--------------------------------------------

The command line terminal will display output similar to the following:

By default {es} prints its logs to `STDOUT` and also to the
`<cluster name>.log` file within `LOGSDIRECTORY`. It will record some
information in the logs while it is starting up but once it has finished
initializing it will continue to run in the foreground but won't log anything
further until something happens that is worth recording. From now on you can
interact with {es} using its HTTP interface, which is on port 9200 by default.
You can stop it by pressing `Ctrl-C`.
