=== GC logging

By default, {es} enables GC logs. These are configured in
<<jvm-options,`jvm.options`>> and default to the same default location as
the Elasticsearch logs. The default configuration rotates the logs every 64
MB and can consume up to 2 GB of disk space.

You can change the default GC logging configuration. Since the preferred
method of <<jvm-options,configuring JVM options>> is not to edit the
default `jvm.options` file, you will need to configure the JVM first to
disable GC logging, in order to cancel out the default {es} configuration,
and then to re-enable logging as you require. See
https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/158[JEP 158: Unified JVM Logging] for details
of how to configure logging.

For example, if you are running {es} using <<docker,Docker>>, you can
choose to send GC logs to standard error (`stderr`) and let your container
orchestrator handle the output. If you were using the `ES_JAVA_OPTS`
environment variable, you would specify:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
docker run -e ES_JAVA_OPTS="-Xlog:disable -Xlog:gc=debug:stderr" # etc
--------------------------------------------
