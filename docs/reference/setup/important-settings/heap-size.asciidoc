=== Heap size settings

By default, {es} will auto-determine the appropriate heap size based on total system memory,
and the set of roles assigned to the node. It is generally recommended that heap size determination
be deferred to {es}. Should you have unique requirements that necessitate setting JVM heap size
manually, refer to <<setting-jvm-heap-size,setting JVM heap size>> for additional guidance.

NOTE: Heap auto-determination requires the use of the <<jvm-version,bundled JDK>> or, if using
a custom JRE location, a Java 14 or later JRE.
