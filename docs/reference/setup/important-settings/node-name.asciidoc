[[node.name]]
=== `node.name`

Elasticsearch uses `node.name` as a human readable identifier for a
particular instance of Elasticsearch so it is included in the response
of many APIs. It defaults to the hostname that the machine has when
Elasticsearch starts. If you'd prefer a different identifier then you
should configure it in `elasticsearch.yml` like so:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
node.name: prod-data-2
--------------------------------------------------
