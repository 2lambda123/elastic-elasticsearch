=== Prerequisites

To follow along with the queries in this getting started guide, first ingest the
following sample data:

==== Run an {esql} query

In {kib}, you can use Console or Discover to run {esql} queries:

include::{es-repo-dir}/tab-widgets/esql/esql-getting-started-widget.asciidoc[]

[[esql-getting-started-first-query]]
==== Your first {esql} query

Each {esql} query starts with a <<esql-commands,source command>>. A source command produces
a table, typically with data from {es}.

[[esql-getting-started-where]]
==== Multiple processing commands

A source command can be followed by one or more
<<esql-commands,processing commands>>. Processing commands change an
input table by adding, removing, or changing rows and columns.
Processing commands can perform filtering, projection, aggregation, and more.

[[esql-getting-started-limit]]
==== Additional processing commands

You can chain processing commands, separated by a pipe character: `|`. Each
processing command works on the output table of the previous command.

The result of a query is the table produced by the final processing command.
