[[esql-max-rows]]
=== Result set size limit

By default, an {esql} query returns up to 500 rows. You can increase the number
of rows up to 10,000 using the <<esql-limit>> command. A query will not return
more than 10,000 rows, regardless of the `LIMIT` command's value.

This limit only applies to the number of rows that are retrieved by the query
and displayed in Discover. Query or aggregations run on the full data set.

To overcome this limitation:

* Reduce the result set size by modifying the query to only return interesting
data. Use <<esql-where>> to select a smaller subset of the data.
