=== How versions work

{esql} language versions are independent of {es} versions.
Versioning the language ensures that your queries will always
remain valid for a version, independent of new {es} and {esql} releases.

For instance, the following query

[source,console]
----
POST /_query?format=txt
{
  "version": "2024.04.01",
  "query": """
    FROM library
    | EVAL release_month = DATE_TRUNC(1 month, release_date)
    | KEEP release_month
    | SORT release_month ASC
    | LIMIT 3
  """
}
----
// TEST[setup:library]

will remain valid, even if a future version of {esql} introduces
syntax changes or changes how the used commands or functions work.

We won't make breaking changes to released {esql} versions and
versions will remain supported until they are deprecated.
New features, bug fixes, and performance improvements
will be continue to be added to released {esql} versions,
provided they do not involve breaking changes.
