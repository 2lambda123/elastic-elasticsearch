=== How versions work

{esql} versions are separate from Elasticsearch versions.
Their goal is to make sure that queries that were once written
remain valid even as Elasticsearch and {esql} evolve.

// TODO: example at 2024.04.01

A released {esql} version will not receive breaking changes and
will remain supported until it is deprecated.
Already released {esql} versions will still profit from new features,
bug fixes and performance improvements as long as those do not
require breaking changes.
