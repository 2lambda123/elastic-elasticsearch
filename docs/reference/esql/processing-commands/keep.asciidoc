=== `KEEP`

**Syntax**

[source,esql]
----
KEEP columns
----

*Parameters*

`columns`::
A comma-separated list of columns to keep. Supports wildcards.

*Description*

The `KEEP` processing command enables you to specify what columns are returned
and the order in which they are returned.

Precedence rules are applied when a field name matches multiple expressions.
Fields are added in the order they appear. If one field matches multiple expressions, the following precedence rules apply (from higher to lower):

1. Complete field name (no wildcards)
2. Partial wildcard expressions (for example: `fieldNam*`)
3. Wildcard only (`*`)

Refer to the examples for illustrations of these precedence rules.

*Examples*

The columns are returned in the specified order:

[source.merge.styled,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keep]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keep-result]
|===

Rather than specify each column by name, you can use wildcards to return all
columns with a name that matches a pattern:

[source,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keepWildcard]
----

The asterisk wildcard (`*`) by itself translates to all columns that do not
match the other arguments.

This query will first return all columns with a name
that starts with `h`, followed by all other columns:

[source,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keepDoubleWildcard]
----

The following examples show how precedence rules work when a field name matches multiple expressions.

Full name duplicates, last one wins:

[source,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keepMultipleMatch]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keep-multiple-match-result]
|===

Complete field name has precedence over wildcard expressions:

[source,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keepCompleteName]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keep-complete-name-result]
|===

Wildcard expressions have the same priority, but last one wins (despite being less specific):

[source,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keepWildcardPrecedence]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keep-wildcard-precedence-result]
|===

// row foo = 1, bar = 2 | keep *, foo   ->  bar, foo

A simple wildcard expression `*` has the lowest priority.
Output order is determined by the other arguments:

[source,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keepWildcardLowest]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keep-wildcard-lowest-result]
|===

[source,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keepWildcardLowest2]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keep-wildcard-lowest-result2]
|===

[source,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keepWildcardLowest3]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=keep-wildcard-lowest-result3]
|===
