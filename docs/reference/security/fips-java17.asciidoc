{es} 8.0+ requires Java 17 or later.  {es} 8.0 to 8.11 have not been tested with a
FIPS certified security module due to a lack of NIST certified security provider
for Java 17. {es} 8.12+ has been tested with https://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html[Bouncy Castle]'s Java 17 certified FIPS implementation
(https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4616[BC-FJA 1.0.2.4])
and is the recommended Java security provider when running {es} in FIPS 140-2 mode.
Note - {es} does not ship with a FIPS certified security provider and requires explicit installation and configuration.

Alternatively, consider using {ess} in the
