[[monitoring-troubleshooting-no-data]]
=== No monitoring data is visible in {kib}

*Symptoms*:
There is no information about your cluster on the *Stack Monitoring* page in
{kib}.

*Resolution*:
Check whether the appropriate indices exist on the monitoring cluster. For
example, use the <<cat-indices,cat indices>> command to verify that
there is a `.monitoring-kibana*` index for your {kib} monitoring data and a
`.monitoring-es*` index for your {es} monitoring data. If you are collecting
monitoring data by using {metricbeat} the indices have `-mb` in their names. If
the indices do not exist, review your configuration. For example, see
<<monitoring-production>>.

[[monitoring-troubleshooting-uuid]]
=== Some monitoring data is missing from {kib}

*Symptoms*:
The information about some nodes, instances, or Beats in your cluster are
missing from the *Stack Monitoring* page in {kib}.

*Resolution*:
Verify that the missing items have unique UUIDs. Each {es} node, {ls} node,
{kib} instance, and Beat is considered unique based on its persistent UUID,
which is found in its `path.data` directory.
