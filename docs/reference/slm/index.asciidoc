== {slm-init}: Manage the snapshot lifecycle

You can set up snapshot lifecycle policies to automate the timing, frequency, and retention of snapshots.
Snapshot policies can apply to multiple indices.

The {slm} ({slm-init}) <<snapshot-lifecycle-management-api, CRUD APIs>> provide
the building blocks for the snapshot policy features that are part of {kib} Management.
{kib-refers}/snapshot-repositories.html[Snapshot and Restore] makes it easy to 
set up policies, register snapshot repositories, view and manage snapshots, and restore indices.

You can stop and restart {slm-init} to temporarily pause automatic backups while performing
upgrades or other maintenance.

[[slm-and-security]]
=== Security and {slm-init}

Two built-in cluster privileges control access to the {slm-init} actions when
{es} {security-features} are enabled:

`manage_slm`:: Allows a user to perform all {slm-init} actions, including creating and updating policies
and starting and stopping {slm-init}.

`read_slm`:: Allows a user to perform all read-only {slm-init} actions,
such as getting policies and checking the {slm-init} status.

`cluster:admin/snapshot/*`:: Allows a user to take and delete snapshots of any
index, whether or not they have access to that index.

You can create and manage roles to assign these privileges through {kibana} Management.

To grant the privileges necessary to create and manage {slm-init} policies and snapshots,
you can set up a role with the `manage_slm` and `cluster:admin/snapshot/*` cluster privileges
and full access to the {slm-init} history indices. 

For example, the following request creates an `slm-admin` role:

[source,console]
-----------------------------------
POST /_security/role/slm-admin
{
  "cluster": ["manage_slm", "cluster:admin/snapshot/*"],
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": [".slm-history-*"],
      "privileges": ["all"]
    }
  ]
}
-----------------------------------
// TEST[skip:security is not enabled here]

To grant read-only access to {slm-init} policies and the snapshot history, 
you can set up a role with the `read_slm` cluster privilege and read access
to the {slm} history indices. 

For example, the following request creates a `slm-read-only` role:

[source,console]
-----------------------------------
POST /_security/role/slm-read-only
{
  "cluster": ["read_slm"],
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": [".slm-history-*"],
      "privileges": ["read"]
    }
  ]
}
-----------------------------------
// TEST[skip:security is not enabled here]
