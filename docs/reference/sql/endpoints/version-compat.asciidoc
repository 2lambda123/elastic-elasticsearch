= Version compatibility

You will need to choose a driver version that will be supported by your {es} server.
For server versions prior to v7.7.0, driver's version will have to exactly match that of server's. For server versions
on or past v7.7.0, driver's version can to be as recent as server's or earlier, but only up to one major version
older. The driver can't be on a version more recent than server's.

Examples:

- a v7.6.1 server will only work with a v7.6.1 driver;
- a v8.1.2 server will work with any driver on v8.1.2 or earlier 8.x version, as well as any 7.x version on or
newer than v7.7.0;
- a v9.2.4 server will work with any driver on v9.2.4 or earlier 9.x version, as well as any 8.x version, but won't
work with any 7.x or earlier driver.
