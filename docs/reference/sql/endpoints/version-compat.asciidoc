* The same version.
* Any earlier version from the server's major version. If the server's major
version is 7.x, only 7.7.0 and later driver versions are compatible.

7.x, only 7.7.0 and later driver versions are compatible.

// Hide this content on 7.x branches
ifeval::[ "{major-version}" != "7.x" ]

// Hide 8.1.0 example on 8.0 branch
ifeval::[ "{minor-version}" != "8.0" ]
An 8.1.0 server is compatible with 8.1.0 and earlier 8.x drivers. An 8.1.0
server is also compatible with 7.7.0 and later 7.x drivers.

// Only display 8.0.0 example on 8.0 branch
ifeval::[ "{minor-version}" == "8.0" ]
An 8.0.0 server is compatible with 8.0.0 drivers. An 8.0.0 server is also
compatible with 7.7.0 and later 7.x drivers.
