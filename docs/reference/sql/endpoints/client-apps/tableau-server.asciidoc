=== Tableau Server

Use the {es} JDBC driver and dedicated {es} Tableau Connector to access {es} data from Tableau Server.

IMPORTANT: Elastic does not endorse, promote or provide support for this application; for native Elasticsearch integration in this
product, please reach out to its vendor.

==== Prerequisites

* https://www.tableau.com/products/server[Tableau Server] 2019.4 or later
* {es-sql} <<sql-jdbc, JDBC driver>>
* https://www.elastic.co/downloads/tableau-connector[{es} Connector for Tableau]

==== Data loading

First place the downloaded JDBC driver in Tableau Server drivers directory:

* Windows: `C:\Program Files\Tableau\Drivers`
* Mac: `/Users/[user]/Library/Tableau/Drivers`

and the {es} Connector for Tableau in Tableau Server connectors directory. Refer to Tableau Server documentation or make use of the TSM
command line interface to find out the location of this directory for your installation.

Then (re)start Tableau Server.

To load data into a workbook, access the _New Data Source_ functionality (from under _Data_ menu or the dedicated icon). In the _Connect
to Data_ window, click on the _Connectors_ tab and choose the _Elasticsearch JDBC by Elastic_ entry:

[[apps_tableau_server_from_connector]]
.Elasticsearch JDBC as data source

Provide the details required to connect to your {es} instance and _Sign In_.

[[apps_tableau_server_connect]]
.Sign in

In Tableau Server's main window then choose the name of {es} instance as the _Database_, select one table that you'd like to load from
the list (click on the magnifying glass icon to have them all listed) and drag the table over the work area to have the table columns
listed:

[[apps_tableau_server_prepare]]
.Choose table to load
