== SQL Client Applications

beta[]

Thanks to its <<sql-jdbc, JDBC>> and <<sql-odbc, ODBC>> interfaces, a broad range of third-party applications can use {es}'s SQL capabilities.
This section lists, in alphabetical order, a number of them and their respective configuration - the list however is by no means comprehensive (feel free to https://www.elastic.co/blog/art-of-pull-request[submit a PR] to improve it):
as long as the app can use the {es-sql} driver, it can use {es-sql}.

* <<sql-client-apps-dbeaver, DBeaver>>
* <<sql-client-apps-dbvis, DbVisualizer>>
* <<sql-odbc-applications-excel, Microsoft Excel>>
* <<sql-odbc-applications-powerbi, Microsoft Power BI Desktop>>
* <<sql-odbc-applications-ps1, Microsoft PowerShell>>
* <<sql-odbc-applications-microstrat, MicroStrategy Desktop>>
* <<sql-odbc-applications-qlik, Qlik Sense Desktop>>
* <<sql-client-apps-squirrel, SQuirreL SQL>>
* <<sql-client-apps-workbench, SQL Workbench>>
* <<sql-odbc-applications-tableau, Tableau Desktop>>

NOTE: Each application has its own requirements and license; these are outside the scope of this documentation
which covers only the configuration aspect with {es-sql}.

WARNING: The support for applications implementing the ODBC 2.x standard and prior is currently limited.
