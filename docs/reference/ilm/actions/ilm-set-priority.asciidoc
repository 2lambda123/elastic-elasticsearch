[[ilm-set-priority]]
=== Set Priority

Phases allowed: hot, warm, cold.

This action sets the <<recovery-prioritization, index priority>> on the index as
soon as the policy enters the hot, warm, or cold phase. Indices with a higher
priority will be recovered before indices with lower priorities following a node
restart. Generally, indexes in the hot phase should have the highest value and
indexes in the cold phase should have the lowest values. For example:
100 for the hot phase, 50 for the warm phase, and 0 for the cold phase.
Indicies that don't set this value have an implicit default priority of 1.
