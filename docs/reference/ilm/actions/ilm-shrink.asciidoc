[[ilm-shrink]]
=== Shrink

Phases allowed: hot, warm.

Sets an index to <<dynamic-index-settings, read-only>>
and shrinks it into a new index with fewer primary shards.
The name of the new index is generated in the form of `shrink-<uuid>-<original-index-name>`.
For example, if the name of the source index is _logs_,
the name of the shrunken index will look like this _shrink-a3ns-logs_.

The generated shrink index name is visible in the explain output, accessible using
the <<ilm-explain-lifecycle, {ilm-init} Explain API>>.

The shrink action allocates all primary shards of the index to one node so it
can call the <<indices-shrink-index,Shrink API>> to shrink the index.
After shrinking, it swaps aliases that point to the original index to the new shrunken index.

The shrink action will attempt to heal a potential hanging operation if one copy of every source index shards
can't be collocated on the target node in preparation for the shrink step (for eg. due to the target node
being permanently removed from the cluster, or no node in the cluster being able to host the necessary
source shards due to lack of disk space) or if the shrunk index cannot be recovered after the shrink step
(for eg. due to conflicting allocation rules).
If such situations are encountered {ilm-init} will wait for a configurable amount of time (dictated by the
`index.lifecycle.step.wait_time_threshold` index setting which defaults to `12h`) before rewinding to a
previous step.
If the shrink index was not yet created (ie. the source index shards could not be collocated)
and the "wait in step" threshold surpassed, {ilm-init} will attempt to choose another node to host the
at least one copy of every source index shards and resume the shrink action from there onwards.
If the shrink index was created but it cannot successfuly recover or allocate, and the "wait in step" threshold
surpassed, {ilm-init} will consider this shrink attempt as failed and will delete the shrink index, generate
a new shrink index name and retry the entire shrink operation on the newly generated index name.

To use the `shrink` action in the `hot` phase, the `rollover` action *must* be present.
If no rollover action is configured, {ilm-init} will reject the policy.

[IMPORTANT]
If the shrink action is used on a <<ccr-put-follow,follower index>>,
policy execution waits until the leader index rolls over (or is
<<skipping-rollover, otherwise marked complete>>),
then converts the follower index into a regular index with the
<<ilm-unfollow,unfollow>> action before performing the shrink operation.

If the managed index is part of a <<data-streams, data stream>>,
the shrunken index replaces the original index in the data stream.

[NOTE]
This action cannot be performed on a data stream's write index. Attempts to do
so will fail. To shrink the index, first
<<manually-roll-over-a-data-stream,manually roll over>> the data stream. This
creates a new write index. Because the index is no longer the stream's write
index, the action can resume shrinking it.
Using a policy that makes use of the <<ilm-rollover, rollover>> action
in the hot phase will avoid this situation and the need for a manual rollover for future
managed indices.

[[ilm-shrink-options]]
==== Shrink options
`number_of_shards`::
(Optional, integer)
Number of shards to shrink to.
Must be a factor of the number of shards in the source index. This parameter conflicts with
`max_primary_shard_size`, only one of them may be set.

`max_primary_shard_size`::
(Optional, <<byte-units, byte units>>)
The max primary shard size for the target index. Used to find the optimum number of shards for the target index.
When this parameter is set, each shard's storage in the target index will not be greater than the parameter.
The shards count of the target index will still be a factor of the source index's shards count, but if the parameter
is less than the single shard size in the source index, the shards count for the target index will be equal to the source index's shards count.
For example, when this parameter is set to 50gb, if the source index has 60 primary shards with totaling 100gb, then the
target index will have 2 primary shards, with each shard size of 50gb; if the source index has 60 primary shards
with totaling 1000gb, then the target index will have 20 primary shards; if the source index has 60 primary shards
with totaling 4000gb, then the target index will still have 60 primary shards. This parameter conflicts
with `number_of_shards` in the `settings`, only one of them may be set.


[[ilm-shrink-ex]]
==== Example

[[ilm-shrink-shards-ex]]
===== Set the number of shards of the new shrunken index explicitly

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _ilm/policy/my_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "warm": {
        "actions": {
          "shrink" : {
            "number_of_shards": 1
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

[[ilm-shrink-size-ex]]
===== Calculate the number of shards of the new shrunken index based on the storage of the
source index and the `max_primary_shard_size` parameter

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _ilm/policy/my_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "warm": {
        "actions": {
          "shrink" : {
            "max_primary_shard_size": "50gb"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
