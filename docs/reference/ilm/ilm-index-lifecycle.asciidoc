[[ilm-index-lifecycle]]
=== Index lifecycle
++++
<titleabbrev>Index lifecycle</titleabbrev>

{ilm-init} splits the index lifecycle into four _phases_: 

* Hot--the index is actively being updated and queried.
* Warm--the index is no longer being updated but is still being queried.
* Cold--the index is no longer being updated and is seldom queried. The
information still needs to be searchable, but it's okay if those queries are
slower.
* Delete--the index is no longer needed and can safely be removed.

An index's _lifecycle policy_ specifies which phases 
are applicable, what actions are performed in each phase,
and when it transitions between phases. 

To automatically apply a lifecycle policy to new time-series indices when they roll over, 
associate the policy with the index template. 
To manage indices that don't roll over, you can manually apply a lifecycle
policy when creating the index.

[[ilm-phase-transitions]]
=== Phase transitions

{ilm-init} moves indices through the lifecycle according to their age. 
To control the timing of these transitions, you set a _minimum age_ for each phase. 
For an index to move to the next phase, all actions in the current phase must be complete and 
the index must be older than the minimum age. 

The minimum age defaults to zero, which causes {ilm-init} to move indices to the next phase
as soon as all actions in the current phase complete. 

[float]
[[ilm-phase-execution]]
=== Phase execution

{ilm-init} controls the order in which the actions in a phase are executed and
what _steps_ are executed to perform the necessary index operations for each action.

When an index enters a phase, {ilm-init} caches the phase definition in the index metadata.
This ensures that policy updates don't put the index into a state where it can never exit the phase.
If changes can be safely applied, {ilm-init} updates the cached phase definition.
If they cannot, phase execution continues using the cached definition.
