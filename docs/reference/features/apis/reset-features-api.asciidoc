Clears the state of features in Elasticsearch, including security and machine
learning indices. This may be useful for testing clusters, but should not be
used in production clusters.

`POST /_features/_reset`


[[reset-features-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

A feature state includes one or more system indices necessary for a given
feature to function. Built-in features and features defined by plugins may
or may not provide endpoints for resetting the state of those features, so
this endpoint provides a high-level way of clearing cluster state.

Use the <<get-features-api,get features API>> to see a list of features that
will be affected by this endpoint. This API clears all features. The list of
features that will be cleared comes from the node against which you issue
this command, so if you have any doubts about which nodes have certain plugins
installed, you will want to issue your command against the master node.
