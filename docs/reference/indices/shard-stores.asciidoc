== Indices Shard Stores

Provides store information for shard copies of indices.
Store information reports on which nodes shard copies exist, the shard
copy version, indicating how recent they are, and any exceptions
encountered while opening the shard index or from earlier engine failure.

By default, only lists store information for shards that have at least one
unallocated copy. When the cluster `status` is yellow, this will list store
information for shards that have at least one unassigned replica. When the
cluster `status` is red, this will list store information for shards, which
are unassigned.

Endpoints include shard stores information for a specific index, several
indices, or all:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/test/_shard_stores'
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/test1,test2/_shard_stores'
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_shard_stores'
--------------------------------------------------

The default scope of shards to list store information can be changed through
`shards` param. Defaults to 'unallocated'.
Using 'allocated' lists store information for active shards and 'all' for
store information on all shards.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_shard_stores?shards=allocated'
--------------------------------------------------

Response:

The shard stores information is grouped by indices and shard ids.
