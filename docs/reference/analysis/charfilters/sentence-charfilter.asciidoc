=== Sentence Char Filter

A char filter of type `sentence` chops the string into the first few
sentences.

Here is a sample configuration:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "index" : {
        "analysis" : {
            "char_filter" : {
                "my_mapping" : {
                    "type" : "sentence"
                }
            },
            "analyzer" : {
                "custom_with_char_filter" : {
                    "tokenizer" : "standard",
                    "char_filter" : ["sentence"]
                },
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the configuration attributes:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Attribute |Description
|`sentences` |The number of sentences to keep.  Defaults to `1`.

|`locale` |Locale to use for sentence splitting.  Defaults to `en_us`.

|`ananlyzed_chars` |Maximum number of characters to check for sentences.
Defaults to `1024`.  If all requested sentences don't fit into this many
characters then all characters up until the last word break before this
many characters are passed to the analyzer.
|=======================================================================

*Note:* All boundaries in this filter are made by Java's BreakIterator,
including the word boundary when there are insufficient analyzed_chars
for the requested number of sentences.
