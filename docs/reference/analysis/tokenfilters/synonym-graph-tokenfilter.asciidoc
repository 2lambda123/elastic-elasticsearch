=== Synonym graph token filter

The `synonym_graph` token filter allows to easily handle <<analysis-synonyms,synonyms>>,
including multi-word synonyms correctly during the analysis process.

In order to properly handle multi-word synonyms this token filter
creates a <<token-graphs,graph token stream>> during processing. For more
information on this topic and its various complexities, please read the
http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2012/04/lucenes-tokenstreams-are-actually.html[Lucene's TokenStreams are actually graphs] blog post.

["NOTE",id="synonym-graph-index-note"]
===============================
This token filter is designed to be used as part of a search analyzer
only. If you want to apply synonyms during indexing please use the
standard <<analysis-synonym-tokenfilter,synonym token filter>>.
===============================

Synonyms can be configured using the <<synonyms-store-synonyms-api,synonyms API>>, a <<synonyms-store-synonyms-file,synonyms file>>, or directly <<synonyms-store-synonyms-inline,inlined>> in the token filter configuration.
See <<synonyms-store-synonyms,store your synonyms set>> for more details on each option.

An example synonyms file configuration:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /test_index
{
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "analysis": {
        "analyzer": {
          "search_synonyms": {
            "tokenizer": "whitespace",
            "filter": [ "graph_synonyms" ]
          }
        },
        "filter": {
          "graph_synonyms": {
            "type": "synonym_graph",
            "synonyms_path": "analysis/synonym.txt"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

The above configures a `search_synonyms` filter, with a path of
`analysis/synonym.txt` (relative to the `config` location). The
`search_synonyms` analyzer is then configured with the filter.

Additional settings are:

* `updateable` (defaults to `false`). If `true` allows
<<indices-reload-analyzers,reloading>> search analyzers to pick up
changes to synonym files. Only to be used for search analyzers.
* `expand` (defaults to `true`).
* `lenient` (defaults to `false`). If `true` ignores exceptions while parsing the synonym configuration. It is important
to note that only those synonym rules which cannot get parsed are ignored. For instance consider the following request:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /test_index
{
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "analysis": {
        "analyzer": {
          "synonym": {
            "tokenizer": "standard",
            "filter": [ "my_stop", "synonym_graph" ]
          }
        },
        "filter": {
          "my_stop": {
            "type": "stop",
            "stopwords": [ "bar" ]
          },
          "synonym_graph": {
            "type": "synonym_graph",
            "lenient": true,
            "synonyms": [ "foo, bar => baz" ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

With the above request the word `bar` gets skipped but a mapping `foo => baz` is still added. However, if the mapping
being added was `foo, baz => bar` nothing would get added to the synonym list. This is because the target word for the
mapping is itself eliminated because it was a stop word. Similarly, if the mapping was "bar, foo, baz" and `expand` was
set to `false` no mapping would get added as when `expand=false` the target mapping is the first word. However, if
`expand=true` then the mappings added would be equivalent to `foo, baz => foo, baz` i.e, all mappings other than the
stop word.

[[synonym-graph-tokenizer-ignore_case-deprecated]]
==== `tokenizer` and `ignore_case` are deprecated

The `tokenizer` parameter controls the tokenizers that will be used to
tokenize the synonym, this parameter is for backwards compatibility for indices that created before 6.0.
The `ignore_case` parameter works with `tokenizer` parameter only.

See <<synonyms-define-synonyms,define your synonyms>> for the available formats to define synonyms.
