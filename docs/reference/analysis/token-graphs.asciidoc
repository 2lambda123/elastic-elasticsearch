[[token-graphs]]
=== Token graphs

When a <<analyzer-anatomy-tokenizer,tokenizer>> converts a text into a stream of
tokens, it also records the position of each token in the stream.

Using these positions, you can create a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph[directed acyclic graph],
called a _token graph_, for a stream. In a token graph, each position represents
a node. Each token represents an edge or arc, pointing to the next position.

[[token-graphs-synonyms]]
==== Synonyms

Some <<analyzer-anatomy-token-filters,token filters>> can add new tokens, like
synonyms, to an existing token stream. These synonyms often span the same
positions as existing tokens.

In the following graph, `quick` and its synonym `fast` both have a position of
`0`. They span the same positions.

[[token-graphs-multi-position-tokens]]
==== Multi-position tokens

Some token filters can add tokens that span multiple positions.

To accommodate this, some of these filters also record a `positionLength`
attribute for multi-position tokens. The `positionLength` indicates the number
of positions a token spans. If a token does not have a recorded
`positionLength`, it defaults to `1`.

In the following graph, `domain name system` and its synonym, `dns`, both have a
position of `0`. However, `dns` has a `positionLength` of `3`. Other tokens in
the graph have a default `positionLength` of `1`.

[[token-graphs-token-graphs-search]]
===== Using token graphs for search 

<<analysis-index-search-time,Indexing>> does not support token graphs containing
multi-position tokens.

However, queries, such as the <<query-dsl-match-query-phrase,`match_phrase`>>
query, can use these graphs to generate multiple sub-queries from a single query
string.

.*Example*
[%collapsible]
====

A user runs a search for the following phrase using the `match_phrase` query:

`domain name system is fragile`

During <<analysis-index-search-time,search analysis>>, `dns`, a synonym for
`domain name system`, is added to the query string's token stream. The `dns`
token has a `positionLength` of `3`.

image::images/analysis/token-graph-dns-synonym-ex.svg[align="center"]

The `match_phrase` query uses this graph to generate sub-queries for the
following phrases:

[source,text]
------
dns is fragile
domain name system is fragile
------

This means the query matches documents containing either `dns is fragile` _or_
`domain name system is fragile`.
====

[[token-graphs-invalid-token-graphs]]
===== Invalid token graphs

Not all token filters record a `positionLength` for multi-position tokens.
This means they produce invalid graphs for streams containing these tokens.

In the following graph, `dns` is a multi-position synonym for `domain name
system`. However, no `positionLength` is recorded for `dns` so it defaults to
`1`. This results in an invalid graph.

Avoid using invalid token graphs for search. Invalid graphs can cause unexpected
search results.
