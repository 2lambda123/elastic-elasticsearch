=== Lowercase Tokenizer


The `lowercase` toknenizer, like the
<<analysis-letter-tokenizer, `letter` tokenizer>> breaks text into terms
whenever it encounters a character which is not a letter, but it also
lowecases all terms.  It is functionally equivalent to the
<<analysis-letter-tokenizer, `letter` tokenizer>> combined with the
<<analysis-lowercase-tokenfilter, `lowercase` token filter>>, but is more
efficient as it performs both steps in a single pass.

=== Example output

[source,js]
---------------------------
POST _analyze
{
  "tokenizer": "lowercase",
  "text": "The 2 QUICK Brown-Foxes jumped over the lazy dog's bone."
}
---------------------------
// CONSOLE

The above sentence would produce the following terms:

[source,text]
---------------------------
[ the, quick, brown, foxes, jumped, over, the, lazy, dog, s, bone ]
---------------------------

=== Configuration

The `lowercase` tokenizer is not configurable.
