=== Letter Tokenizer

The `letter` tokenizer breaks text into terms whenever it encounters a
character which is not a letter. It does a reasonable job for most European
languages, but does a terrible job for some Asian languages, where words are
not separated by spaces.

=== Example output

[source,js]
---------------------------
POST _analyze
{
  "tokenizer": "letter",
  "text": "The 2 QUICK Brown-Foxes jumped over the lazy dog's bone."
}
---------------------------
// CONSOLE

The above sentence would produce the following terms:

[source,text]
---------------------------
[ The, QUICK, Brown, Foxes, jumped, over, the, lazy, dog, s, bone ]
---------------------------

=== Configuration

The `letter` tokenizer is not configurable.
