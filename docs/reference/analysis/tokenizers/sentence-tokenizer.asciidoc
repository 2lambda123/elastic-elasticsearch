=== Sentence Tokenizer

A tokenizer of type `sentence` providing breaks a text into sentences.

For example, if you have:

------------------------
Hello world! How are you? I am fine.
This is a difficult sentence because I use I.D.

Newlines should also be accepted. Numbers should not cause
sentence breaks, like 1.23.
------------------------

the output will be six tokens:

* `Hello world! `
* `How are you? `
* `I am fine.\n`
* `This is a difficult sentence because I use I.D.\n\n`
* `Newlines should also be accepted. `
* `Numbers should not cause \nsentence breaks, like 1.23.`
