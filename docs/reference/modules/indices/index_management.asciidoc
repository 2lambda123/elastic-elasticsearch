=== Index management settings

You can configure these index settings in the `elasticsearch.yml` file.

[[auto-create-index]]
// tag::auto-create-index-tag[]
`action.auto_create_index` {ess-icon}::
<<index-creation,Automatically create an index>> if it doesn't already exist and apply any configured index templates. Default: `true`.
// end::auto-create-index-tag[]

[[action-destructive-requires-name]]
// tag::action-destructive-requires-name-tag[]
`action.destructive_requires_name` {ess-icon}::
When set to `true`, you must specify the index name to <<indices-delete-index,delete an index>>. It is not possible to delete all indices with `_all` or use wildcards.
// end::action-destructive-requires-name-tag[]

[[cluster-indices-close-enable]]
// tag::cluster-indices-close-enable-tag[]
`cluster.indices.close.enable` {ess-icon}::
Enables <<indices-open-close,opening of closed indices>> in {es}. You might enable this setting temporarily to change the analyzer configuration for an existing index. We strongly recommend leaving this set to `false` (the default) otherwise.

IMPORTANT: Closed indices are a data loss risk because they are not included when you make cluster configuration changes, such as scaling to a different capacity, failover, and many other operations. Additionally, closed indices can lead to inaccurate disk space counts.
