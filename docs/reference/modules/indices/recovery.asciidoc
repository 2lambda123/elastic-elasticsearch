=== Indices Recovery

_Recovery_ is the process used to build a new copy of a shard on a node by
copying data from the primary. {es} uses this recovery process to rebuild shard
copies that were lost if a node has failed, and uses the same process when
migrating a shard copy between nodes to rebalance the cluster or to honour any
changes to the <<modules-cluster,shard allocation settings>>.

The following _expert_ setting can be set to manage the resources consumed by
recoveries:

`indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec`::
    Limits the total inbound and outbound recovery traffic on each node. If you
    set this limit too high then there is a risk that ongoing recoveries will
    consume an excess of bandwidth (or other resources) which could destabilise
    the cluster. Since this setting applies to each node separately, the total
    bandwidth that might be used by recoveries is this setting multiplied by
    half of the number of nodes in the cluster. Defaults to `40mb`.

This setting can be dynamically updated on a live cluster with the
<<cluster-update-settings,cluster-update-settings>> API.
