== Remote clusters
You can connect a local cluster to other {es} clusters, known as _remote
clusters_. Remote clusters can be located in different datacenters or 
geographic regions, and contain indices or data streams that can be replicated
with {ccr} or searched by a local cluster using {ccs}.

[[remote-clusters-ccr]]
[discrete]
=== {ccr-cap}

With <<xpack-ccr,{ccr}>>, you ingest data to an index on a remote cluster. This 
_leader_ index is replicated to one or more read-only _follower_ indices on your local cluster. Creating a multi-cluster architecture with {ccr} enables you to 
configure disaster recovery, bring data closer to your users, or establish a 
centralized reporting cluster to process reports locally.

[[remote-clusters-ccs]]
[discrete]
=== {ccs-cap}

<<modules-cross-cluster-search,{ccs-cap}>> enables you to run a search request
against one or more remote clusters. This capability provides each region with a
global view of all clusters, allowing you to send a search request from a local
cluster and return results from all connected remote clusters. For full {ccs}
capabilities, the local and remote cluster must be on the same
{subscriptions}[subscription level].

=== Add remote clusters

To add remote clusters, you can choose between two security models:

API key based security model::
beta:[]
Uses an API key to authenticate and authorize cross-cluster operations to a 
remote cluster. This model offers administrators of both the local and the 
remote cluster fine-grained access controls. <<remote-clusters-api-key>>.

Certificate based security model::
Uses mutual TLS authentication for cross-cluster operations. User authentication
is performed on the local cluster and a user's role names are passed to the 
remote cluster. In this model, a superuser on the local cluster gains total read
access to the remote cluster, so it is only suitable for clusters that are in
the same security domain <<remote-clusters-cert>>.
