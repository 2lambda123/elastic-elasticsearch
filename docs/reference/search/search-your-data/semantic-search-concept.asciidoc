== Semantic search

//tag::semantic-def[]
Semantic search uses a text embedding NLP model to generate a dense vector from 
the input query string. The resulting dense vector is then used in a 
<<knn-search,k-nearest neighbor (knn) search>> against an index containing dense 
vectors created with the same text embedding model. The search results are 
semantically similar as learned by the model.
