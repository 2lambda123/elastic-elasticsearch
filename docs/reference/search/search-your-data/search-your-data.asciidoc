[[search-query]]
A _search query_, or _query_, is a request for information about data in
{es} data streams or indices.

You can think of a query as a question, written in a way {es} understands.
Depending on your data, you can use a query to get answers to questions like:

* What processes on my server take longer than 500 milliseconds to respond?
* What users on my network ran `regsvr32.exe` within the last week?
* What pages on my website contain a specific word or phrase?

{es} supports several search methods:

<<search-for-exact-values,Search for exact values>>::
Search for exact values or ranges for numbers, dates, IPs, or strings.

<<full-text-search,Full-text search>>::
Search unstructured textual data to find documents that best match search
terms.

<<semantic-search,Semantic search>>::
Find data based on the intent and contextual meaning of a search query, instead
of a match on query terms (lexical search).

<<knn-search,Vector search>>::
Store vectors, numeric representations of data, in {es} and use approximate
nearest neighbor (ANN) or k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithms to find vectors
that are similar.

=== Run a search

To run a search request, you can use the search API or search applications.

<<search-your-data,Search API>>::
The <<search-search,search API>> enables you to search and
<<search-aggregations,aggregate>> data stored in {es} using a query language
called the <<query-dsl,Query DSL>>.

<<search-applications,Search Applications>>::
Search Applications enable you to leverage the full power of {es} and its Query
DSL, with a simplified user experience. Create search applications based on your
{es} indices, build queries using search templates, and easily preview your
results directly in the Kibana Search UI.
