== Semantic search

Semantic search is a search method that helps you find data based on the intent
and contextual meaning of a search query, instead of a match on query terms
(lexical search).

{es} provides semantic search capabilities using {ml-docs}/ml-nlp.html[natural
language processing (NLP)] and vector search. Deploying an NLP model to {es}
enables it to extract text embeddings out of text. Embeddings are vectors that
provide a mathematical representation of a text. Pieces of content with similar
meaning have similar representations.

At query time, {es} can use the same NLP model to convert a query into
embeddings, enabling you to find documents with similar text embeddings.

This guide shows you how to implement semantic search with {es}, from selecting
an NLP model, to writing queries.
