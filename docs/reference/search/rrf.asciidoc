Reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) is a method for combining results from
multiple queries with different relevance indicators into a single
result set where there is no requirement the relevance indicators for
each query are related to each other in order to achieve high-quality results.

RRF uses the following formula to determine the score for ranking each document:

[source,python]
----
score = 0.0
for q in queries:
    if d in result(q):
        score += 1.0 / ( k + rank( result(q), d ) )
return score

# where
# k is a ranking constant
# q is a query in the set of queries
# d is a document in the result set of q
# result(q) is the result set of q
# rank( result(q), d ) is d's rank within the result(q) starting from 1

[[rrf-api]]
==== Reciprocal rank fusion API

RRF may be used as part of a <<search-search, search>> to combine and rank
documents using either a single standard query and 1-to-many knn searches or no standard
query and 2-to-many knn searches. The `rrf` parameter is an optional object defined as part
of a search request's <<request-body-rank, rank parameter>>.

The `rrf` object contains the following parameters:

`rank_constant`::
(Optional, integer) This value determines how much influence documents in individual
result sets per query have over the final ranked result set. A higher value indicates
that lower ranked documents have more influence. This value must be greater than or
equal to `1`. Defaults to `60`.

`window_size`::
(Optional, integer) This value determines the size of the individual results sets per
query. A higher value will improve result relevance at the cost of performance. The final
ranked result set is pruned down to the search request's <<search-api-query-params-q, size>.
`window_size` must be greater than or equal to `size` and greater than or equal to `1`.
Defaults to `100`.

An example request using RRF:

[source,console]
----
GET rrf-index/_search
{
    "query": {                       <1>
        "term": {
            "rrf_text": "shoes"
        }
    },
    "knn": {                         <2>
        "field": "rrf-vector",
        "query_vector": [1.25, 2, 3.5],
        "k": 50,
        "num_candidates": 100
    },
    "rank": {                        <3>
        "rrf": {                     <4>
            "window_size": 50,       <5>
            "rank_constant": 20      <6>
        }
    }
}
----
// TEST[skip:example request only]
<1> a standard query
<2> a knn search
<3> the `rank` object
<4> the `rrf` object
<5> the `window_size` set to `50`
<6> the `rank_constant` set to `20`

The above example uses RRF to combine and rank the standard query and knn search.

[[rrf-full-example]]
==== Reciprocal rank fusion full example

We begin by creating a mapping for an rrf-index with a text field, a vector field,
and an integer field along with indexing several documents. For this example we
are going to use a vector with only a single dimension to make the ranking easier
to explain.

[source,console]
----
PUT rrf-index
{
  "mappings": {
        "properties": {
            "rrf_text" : {
                "type" : "text"
            },
            "rrf_vector": {
                "type": "dense_vector",
                "dims": 1,
                "index": true,
                "similarity": "l2_norm"
            },
            "rrf_integer" : {
                "type" : "integer"
            }
        }
    }
}

PUT rrf-index/_doc/1
{
    "rrf_text" : "rrf",
    "rrf_vector" : [5],
    "rrf_integer": 1
}

PUT rrf-index/_doc/2
{
    "rrf_text" : "rrf rrf",
    "rrf_vector" : [4],
    "rrf_integer": 2
}

PUT rrf-index/_doc/3
{
    "rrf_text" : "rrf rrf rrf",
    "rrf_vector" : [3],
    "rrf_integer": 1
}

PUT rrf-index/_doc/4
{
    "rrf_text" : "rrf rrf rrf rrf",
    "rrf_integer": 2
}

PUT rrf-index/_doc/5
{
    "rrf_vector" : [1],
    "rrf_integer": 1
}

POST rrf-index/_refresh
----
// TEST

We now execute a search using RRF with a standard query, a knn search, and
a terms aggregation.

[source,console]
----
GET rrf-index/_search
{
    "query": {
        "term": {
            "rrf_text": "rrf"
        }
    },
    "knn": {
        "field": "rrf_vector",
        "query_vector": [3],
        "k": 5,
        "num_candidates": 5
    },
    "rank": {
        "rrf": {
            "window_size": 5,
            "rank_constant": 1
        }
    },
    "size": 3,
    "aggs": {
        "rrf_int_count": {
            "terms": {
                "field": "rrf_integer"
            }
        }
    }
}
----
// TEST[continued]

And we receive the response with a ranked result set and the
terms aggregation result.
