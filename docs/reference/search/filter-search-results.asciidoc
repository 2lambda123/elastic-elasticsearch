== Filter search results

You can use two methods to filter search results:

* Use a boolean query with a `filter` query clause. Search requests apply
<<query-dsl-bool-query,boolean filters>> to both search hits and <<search-aggregations,aggregations>>.


* Use the search API's `post_filter` parameter. Search requests apply 
<<post-filter,post filters>> only to search hits, not aggregations.
+
You can also <<rescore,rescore>> hits after the post filter to
improve relevance and reorder results.
