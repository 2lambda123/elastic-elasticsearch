== Filter search results

You can use two methods to filter search results:

* Use a boolean query with a `filter` query clause. Search requests apply
boolean filters to both search hits and <<search-aggregations,aggregations>>.
See <<query-dsl-bool-query,boolean query>>.

* Use the search API's `post_filter` parameter. Search requests apply post
filters only to search hits, not aggregations. See <<post-filter>>.
+
If wanted, you can also <<rescore,rescore>> hits after the post filter to
improve relevance and reorder results. See <<rescore>>.
