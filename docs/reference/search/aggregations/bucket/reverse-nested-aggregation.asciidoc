=== Reverse nested

A special single bucket aggregation that enables aggregating on parent docs from nested documents. Effectively this
aggregation can break out of the nested block structure and link to other nested structures or the root document,
which allows nesting other aggregations that aren't part of the nested object in a nested aggregation.

For example, lets say we have an index for a ticket system which issues and comments. The commends are inlined into
the issue documents as nested documents. The mapping could look like:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    ...

    "issue" : {
        "properties" : {
            "tags" : { "type" : "string" }
            "comments" : { <1>
                "type" : "nested"
                "properties" : {
                    "username" : { "type" : "string", "index" : "not_analyzed" },
                    "comment" : { "type" : "string" }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

<1> The `comments` is an array that holds nested documents under the `issue` object.

The following aggregations will return the top commenters' username that have commented and per top commenter the top
tags that issues have the commenter has commented to:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "query" : {
        "match" : { "name" : "led tv" }
    }
    "aggs" : {
        "comments" : {
            "nested" : {
                "path" : "comments"
            },
            "aggs" : {
                "top_usernames" : {
                    "terms" : {
                        "field" : "comments.username"
                    }
                },
                "aggs" : {
                    "comment_to_issue" : {
                        "reverse_nested" : {
                            "path" : "root", <2>

                        },
                        "aggs" : {
                            "top_tags_per_comment" : {
                                "terms" : { "field" : "tags" }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

As you can see above, the the `reverse_nested` aggregation is put in to a `nested` aggregation as this is the only place
in the dsl where the `reversed_nested` aggregation can be used. Its sole purpose is to join back to a parent doc up
higher up in the nested structure.

<2> The value `root` in path points to the the main / root document, since there isn't field for the root document this
value should be used if joining back to the main document is required. Another nested field higher up the nested
structure in the path is also a valid value.

Possible response snippet:

[source,js]

    "aggregations": {
        "comments": {
            "top_usernames": {
                "buckets" : [
                    {
                        "key" : "username_1",
                        "doc_count" : 12,
                        "comment_to_issue" : {
                            "top_tags_per_comment" : {
                                "buckets" : [
                                    {
                                        "key" : "tag1",
                                        "doc_count" : 9
                                    },
                                    ...
                                ]
                            }
                        },
                        ...
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
