=== Paginate search results

By default, the search API returns documents for only the top 10 search
results, starting with the first, most relevant document.

To paginate a larger set of search results, you can use the search API's `size`
and `from` parameters. The `from` parameter is a zero-indexed offset from
the first result you want to fetch. The `size` parameter sets the maximum
number of results to return.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The combined document count, including offset and and returned documents, for
the `from` and `size` parameters cannot exceed the
<<index-max-result-window,`index.max_result_window`>> index setting, which
defaults to 10,000 documents.
====

.*Example*
[%collapsible]
====
The following search API request sets the `from` offset to `5`, meaning the
request offset the first five results. Documents for those results won't be
included in the response.

The `size` parameter is `20`, meaning that the request can return up to 20
results, starting at the `offset`.

WARNING: {es} uses Lucene's internal doc IDs as tie-breakers. These internal
doc IDs can be completely different across replicas of the same
data. When paginating, you might occasionally see that documents with the same
sort values are not ordered consistently. For deep scrolling, it is more
efficient to use the <<request-body-search-scroll,Scroll>> or 
<<request-body-search-search-after,Search After>> APIs.
