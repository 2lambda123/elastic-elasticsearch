== Analysis Module

The analysis module enables you to register <<analysis-analyzers,analyzers>>, 
<<analysis-tokenizers,tokenizers>>, <<analysis-charfilters,character filters>>, 
and <<analysis-tokenfilters,token filters>> under logical 
names that you can reference in mapping definitions. You can 
also reference them when using the `<<indices-analyze,analyze>>`
and <<search, search>> APIs.  

The built in analyzers, tokenizers, character filters, and token filters are
registered automatically. 

See <<analysis>> for more information about configuring and using
analyzers.
