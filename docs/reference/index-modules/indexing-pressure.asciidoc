== Indexing Pressure

Indexing documents into Elasticsearch introduces system load in the form of
memory and CPU load. Each indexing operation includes coordinating, primary, and
replica stages. These stages can be performed across multiple nodes in the
cluster. If too much indexing work is introduced into the system, the cluster
can become saturated. This can adversely impact other components of the system
such as searches, cluster coordination, background processing, etc.

Indexing pressure is primarily generated by external operations such as indexing
requests or internally by mechanisms such recoveries and cross-cluster
replication.

Elasticsearch internally monitors indexing load. When the load exceeds
certain limits, new indexing work will be rejected.

=== Indexing Stages

External indexing operations go through three stages. The node receiving the
indexing request is the coordinating node. In the coordinating stage the node
performs any configured ingest pipelines, separates the request into individual
shard requests, and dispatches the requests to the primary shards.

In the primary stage, the primary shard node ensures that it is still the primary
(otherwise it reroutes the request to the new primary), waits on active shards,
indexes the documents into Lucene and the <<index-modules-translog,Translog>>, and
replicates the writes to the replica shards.

Finally, in the replica stage, every available replica node indexes the documents
into Lucene and the <<index-modules-translog,Translog>>.

=== Memory Limits

Elasticsearch exposes a node setting `indexing_pressure.memory.limit` which
restricts the number of bytes for outstanding indexing requests. Be default,
this setting is configured to be 10% of the heap.

A node will start rejecting new indexing work at the coordinating or primary
stage when the number of outstanding coordinating, primary and replica indexing
requests is greater than the configured limit.

A node will start rejecting new indexing work at the replica stage when the
number of outstanding replica indexing requests is greater than 1.5x the
configured limit. This design means that as indexing pressure builds on nodes,
they will naturally stop accepting coordinating and primary work in favor of
outstanding replica work.

The default limit `indexing_pressure.memory.limit` (10%) is generously sized and
should only be modified after careful consideration. Only indexing requests
contribute to this limit meaning that there is additional indexing overhead
(buffers, listeners, etc) which also require heap space. Finally, other
components of Elasticsearch also require memory. Configuring this limit to be
too high can starve other system components of operating memory.

=== Monitoring

Indexing pressure metrics are exposed by the
<<cluster-nodes-stats-api-response-body-indexing-pressure,Node Stats API>>.
