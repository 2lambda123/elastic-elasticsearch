`from`::
(Optional, integer) The offset from the first result to fetch.

`index_name`::
(Optional, string) A comma-separated list of index names associated with connectors, used to filter search results.
// What is the maximum number of index names that can be specified?
// Does this have to be an exact match or are regexes also accepted?
// "data index" - I don't believe we refer to indices as data indices anywhere else

(Optional, string) A comma-separated list of connector names, used to filter search results.
// What is the maximum number of names that can be specified?
// Does this have to be an exact match or are regexes also accepted?
// If we accept any name as connector name, what encoding is accepted as parameter? e.g. how would a request for a connector named "My test connector" look like?
