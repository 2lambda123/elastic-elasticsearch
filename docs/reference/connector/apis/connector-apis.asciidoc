== Connector APIs

beta::[]

The connector and sync jobs APIs provide a convenient way to create and manage Elastic {enterprise-search-ref}/connectors.html[connectors^] and sync jobs in an internal index.

Connectors are {es} integrations that bring content from third-party data sources, which can be deployed on {ecloud} or hosted on your own infrastructure:

* *Native connectors* are a managed service on {ecloud}
* *Connector clients* are self-managed on your infrastructure

Find a list of all supported service types in the {enterprise-search-ref}/connectors.html[connectors documentation^].

This API provides an alternative to relying solely on {kib} UI for connector and sync job management. The API comes with a set of
validations and assertions to ensure that the state representation in the internal index remains valid.

[TIP]
====
We also have a command-line interface for Elastic connectors. Learn more in the https://github.com/elastic/connectors/blob/main/docs/CLI.md[elastic/connectors] repository.

=== Connector Service APIs

preview::[]

*Connector Service APIs* are a set of framework-level endpoints related to connectors and sync jobs. All operations are governed by the https://github.com/elastic/connectors/blob/main/docs/CONNECTOR_PROTOCOL.md[Connector Protocol]. These APIs are not intended for direct connector management by users but are there to support the implementation of services that utilize the Conector Protocol to communicate with {es}.

[TIP]
===
All Elastic connectors are built using our Python connector framework. The source code is available in the https://github.com/elastic/connectors[elastic/connectors] repository on GitHub.
