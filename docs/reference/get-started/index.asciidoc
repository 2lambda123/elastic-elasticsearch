This section is aimed at developers who are just getting started with {es}, for evaluation or development purposes.

The first thing you need to try out {es} is a running instance of the service.
There are many ways to run {es}, but here we're focused on two options: {ecloud} and Docker.
If you're looking to deploy {es} in production, or use an alternative installation method, refer to <<setup>>.

[TIP]
====
If you get started with {es} in {ecloud}, you'll be ready to go to production from day one.
