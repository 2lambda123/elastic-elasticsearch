=== Find {es} endpoint

The {es} endpoint is the URL you use to access your {es} instance.

To find this URL on {ecloud}:

. Go to your https://cloud.elastic.co/deployments[{ecloud} deployments] page.
. To open your deployment's UI, select *Open*.
. Select *Search* on your deployment's home page.
. Copy your {es} endpoint.

If you're using a self-managed {es} instance, your URL will look something like this:
`https://localhost:9200`.

=== Find Cloud ID

[NOTE]
====
Cloud IDs do not apply to self-managed {es} instances.
You'll need your <<endpoints-keys-elasticsearch, {es} endpoint>> instead.

Your Cloud ID simplifies sending data to your cluster on Elastic Cloud.
It's the recommended option for connecting to Elasticsearch for many of our programming language clients and connectors.

To find the Cloud ID for your deployment:

. Go to your https://cloud.elastic.co/deployments[{ecloud} deployments] page.
. To open your deployment's UI, select *Open*.
. Select *Search* on your deployment's home page.
. Copy your Cloud ID.

[TIP]
====
Use the *Endpoints* quicklink anywhere within the *Search* section of your deployment's UI to quickly copy your {es} endpoint, Cloud ID, and manage API keys.
Find this button in the top right corner of your UI.
