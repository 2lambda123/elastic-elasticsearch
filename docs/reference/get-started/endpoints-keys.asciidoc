[[endpoints-keys-elasticsearch]]
=== Find {es} endpoint

The {es} endpoint is the URL you use to access your {es} instance.

To find this URL on {ecloud}:

. Go to your https://cloud.elastic.co/deployments[{ecloud} deployments] page.
. Select your deployment.
. Select *Copy endpoint* beside {es}.

If you're using a self-managed {es} instance, your URL will look something like this:
`https://localhost:9200`.

[[endpoints-keys-cloud-id]]
=== Find Cloud ID

[NOTE]
====
Cloud IDs do not apply to self-managed {es} instances.
You'll need your <<endpoints-keys-elasticsearch, {es} endpoint>> instead.
====

Your Cloud ID simplifies sending data to your cluster on Elastic Cloud.
It's the recommended option for connecting to Elasticsearch for many of our programming language clients and connectors.

To find the Cloud ID for your deployment:

. Go to your https://cloud.elastic.co/deployments[{ecloud} deployments] page.
. Select your deployment.
. Select *Manage*.
. Copy the Cloud ID on that screen.

[TIP]
====
If you want to jump straight into your deployment's UI from the *Deployments* overview, select the *Open Kibana* button.

[[endpoints-keys-api-keys-create-ui]]
==== Create API keys in UI

Alternatively, simply search for *API Keys* in the global search bar in your UI.
Select *Create API key*.
