  anchor: remove_fixed_auto_queue_size_threadpool_type
  body: >-
    The fixed_auto_queue_size thread pool holds a fixed size of threads to
    handle the requests with a bounded queue for pending requests that have no
    threads to service them. It's similar to the fixed threadpool, however, the
    queue_size automatically adjusts according to calculations based on

    Little's Law. This dynamic adjustment was, by default, disabled for the two fixed_auto_queue_size thread pools (search and search_throttled).

    As this feature was marked as experimental, and we are unaware of any users explicitly configuring this, we intent to deprecate it in ES 7 and remove it in ES 8.
