  title: Unattended mode for transforms
  body: |-
    The new `unattended` setting for transforms introduces unattended mode. It 
    enables the transform to retry indefinitely, even in the face of errors that 
    require direct intervention to resolve. For example, a high disk watermark 
    may prevent all ingest activities, including the indexing operation of a 
    transform; however once the original issue is resolved by the system 
    administrator, the transform automatically continues to operate from where it 
    stopped working. Neither the system administrator nor the end-user need to 
    restart the transform.

    === Frequent items aggregation

    The 
    {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-frequent-items-aggregation.html[frequent items aggregation] 
    is a new bucket aggregation which identifies items that often occur 
    together. It is a form of association rule mining that helps to discover 
    relationships between different data points. For example, the aggregation 
    can find attributes of log events that tend to co-occur and may give a more informative 
    explanation for the possible causes of a spike in the logs.
