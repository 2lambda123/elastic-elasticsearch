  body: |-
    With the geo grid query, you can now natively return all the documents that overlap a specific geo tile.
    There is no need to reconstruct the geometry or the actual boundaries of the spatial cluster as Elasticsearch
    can do this for you, which saves you time and reduces complexity.
    This is especially useful when geometries are spread across tiles like on a soccer ball or football.
    While hexagon tiles line the sphere, calculating the boundary of each tile is not straightforward.

    ```
    GET /example/_search
    {
      "query": {
        "geo_grid" :{
          "location" : {
            "geotile" : "6/32/22"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Geo grid query can also help determine the single source of truth of containment.
    With geo grid query, you can match exactly the intersection-test of Elasticsearch.
    As an example, if a client has bounds for a grid-cell at a higher (or lower) precision than what is used
    by Elasticsearch when running a corresponding aggregation, the containment-check might be slightly different.
    This side-steps any disconnect based on projection/datum difference between client and Elasticsearch.
