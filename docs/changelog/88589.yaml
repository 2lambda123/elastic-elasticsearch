    === Early stopping for data frame analytics
    Data frame analytics is even faster in 8.4. The new function automatically 
    stops the process of hyperparameter optimization early in case of the 
    accuracy gain for a different set of hyperparameter values would be 
    insignificant. The early stopping of the optimization process results in a 
    shorter runtime for the data frame analytics job.
