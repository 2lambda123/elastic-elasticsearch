  title: Add support for dots in field names for metrics usecases
  body: |-
    Metrics data cabn often be made of several fields with dots in their names, m
    sharing common prefixes, like in the following example:

    ```
    {
      "metrics.time" : 10,
      "metrics.time.min" : 1,
      "metrics.time.max" : 500
    }
    ```

    Such format cause a mapping conflict as the `metrics.time` holds a value,
    but it also needs to be mapped as an object in order to hold the `min` and
    `max` leaf fields.

    A new object mapping parameter called `subobjects`, which defaults to `true`,
    has been introduced to preserve dots in field names. An object with `subobjects`
    set to `false` supports only hold leaf sub-fields and no further objects. The
    following example shows how it can be configured in the mappings for the
    `metrics` object:

    ```
    {
      "mappings": {
        "properties" : {
          "metrics" : {
            "type" : "object",
            "subobjects" : false
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
