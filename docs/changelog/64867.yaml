  title: Remove the deprecated local parameter for _cat/shards
  anchor: remove_the_deprecated_local_parameter_for_cat_shards
  body: >-
    The cat shards API performs a `ClusterStateAction` and then an
    `IndicesStatsAction`. Today it accepts the `?local` parameter and passes
    this to the `ClusterStateAction` but this parameter has no effect on the
    `IndicesStatsAction`. This can be surprising because `GET _cat/shards?local`
    looks like it might be a completely local call but in fact it still depends
    on every node in the cluster.

    The `local` parameter was deprecated in 7.x and this commit removes it for 8.x.
