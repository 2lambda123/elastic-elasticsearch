   The 
   {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-frequent-items-aggregation.html[frequent items aggregation] 
   is a new bucket aggregation which identifies items that often occur together. 
   It is a form of association rules mining that helps to discover relationships 
   between different data points. For example, the aggregation can find log 
   events that tend to co-occur and may give a more informative explanation for 
   the possible causes of a spike in the logs.
