  body: |-
    This commit removes the WatcherClient and WatcherRestHandler from the
    codebase. The WatcherClient was a convenience wrapper around the
    transport client, which is being removed so the client no longer serves
    a purpose. The WatcherRestHandler is no longer needed as its primary
    purpose was to provide a WatcherClient to the implementing handlers.
