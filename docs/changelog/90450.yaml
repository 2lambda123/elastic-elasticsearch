  title: Semantic search
  body: |-
    Semantic search uses an NLP model to generate a dense vector representation 
    of the given query text. This vector, known as an embedding, is passed to 
    kNN vector search to find related documents which are nearby in the vector 
    space. Documents that are close together in vector space have a semantically 
    similar meaning. This process makes it possible to find results that are not 
    only lexically similar to the query but in the intent or the meaning of the 
    text. For example the NLP model may understand that some words or phrases 
    are essentially synonyms and unearth documents that would not be discovered 
    by traditional lexical match. The potential of semantic search is boosted by 
    combining kNN vector search with Elasticsearch queries in a hybrid retrieval 
    strategy.
