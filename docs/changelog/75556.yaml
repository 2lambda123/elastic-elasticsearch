  title: Reject paginated search request exceeds rescore window
  area: Search
  details: |-
    A search request with a positive `from` and the sum of `from` and `size`
    that exceeds the window size of rescorers can return inconsistent
    results. I think we should reject such a request.

    Closes #75363
