  title: Introducing ES|QL â€” A new query language for flexible, iterative analytics
  body: |-
    As the Elastic Platform has become more widely adopted for search, security, observability, and general analytics,
    analyst users require the ability to take data-as-ingested, transform it to fit their investigative needs
    post-ingestion, and derive insights from underlying Elasticsearch index data. They need a concise, integrated,
    and efficient workflow enabled by rich and expressive queries where search, filter, aggregation,
    and transformation are performed via a single query expression with little-to-no UI context switching.

    To solve these challenges, the Elastic team is developing the <<esql,Elasticsearch Query Language (ES|QL)>>.
    ES|QL provides Elastic users with a flexible, powerful, and robust query expression language to interrogate data.
    ES|QL also provides a superior query UX with post-ingest processing capabilities that fundamentally transforms
    and expands the analytics and data processing capabilities of Elasticsearch.

    ES|QL introduces distributed compute capabilities to users in disparate roles and with varying skill levels.
    These compute capabilities enable ES|QL to simplify user workflows in several key ways.

    * Utilize a superior query UX: ES|QL query expressions support complex analytics and data processing.
      They are easy to learn, read, and share.
    * Use the filter, aggregation, and transformation capabilities of Elasticsearch with subqueries and lookups,
      made possible by new Elasticsearch compute and data processing capabilities.
    * Use ES|QL across Kibana in Discover, Kibana Lens, and Elastic Solutions, giving you seamless workflows.
      You will be able to visualize ES|QL queries, share them with teams on dashboards or as queries,
      and use queries to create custom alerts.
