  body: >-
    This commit removes the types filter from the GetMappings API, which is no
    longer

    useful seeing as we can only have a single mapping type per index.  It also changes

    the structure of GetMappingsResponse and GetIndexResponse to remove the extra

    nesting of mappings below the no-longer-relevant type name, and removes the types

    methods from the equivalent request classes.

    Relates to #41059
