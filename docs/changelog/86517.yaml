  title: Enable HLRC compatibility mode by default
  area: REST API
  details: |-
    Compatibility mode allows HLRC to communicate with {es} 8.x by sending version information in the `Content-Type` and `Accept`
    request headers, which causes {es} 8 to behave like {es} 7. As this feature isn't very well known, a number of users had
    the wrong impression that HLRC 7.17 was not working with {es} 8.

    Compatibility mode is now enabled by default, allowing it to work out of the box with {es} 8.
  impact: |-
    Compatibilty mode was introduced in {es} 7.11. Using HLRC 7.17.4 with {es} 7.10 and before therefore requires to disable
    compatibility mode when creating an HLRC instance.
