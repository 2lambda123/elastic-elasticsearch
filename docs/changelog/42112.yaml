  body: >-
    This change will remove the notion of types completely from the Search API
    internals.

    For classes that are serialised (such as `SearchRequest`, `IdsQuery`, `ShardLocalSearchRequest`) we need to check for the wire version and deal with the types serialisation if the other node is `<8.0.0`
