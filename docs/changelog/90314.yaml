  title: Errors with the `cross_fields` query type
  body: |-
    The 8.4.2 release introduced a bug that may fail queries that use the
    `cross_fields` type at search time with an error message containing
    `totalTermFreq must be at least docFreq`. Users of the `cross_fields` type
    are recommended to upgrade to 8.4.3 to avoid hitting this bug.
