  title: Fail node containing ancient closed index
  anchor: fail_node_containing_ancient_closed_index
  body: >-
    Today we fail the node at startup if it contains an index that is too old to
    be

    compatible with the current version, unless that index is closed. If the index

    is closed then the node will start up and this puts us into a bad state: the

    index cannot be opened and must be reindexed using an earlier version, but we

    offer no way to get that index into a node running an earlier version so that

    it can be reindexed. Downgrading the node in-place is decidedly unsupported and

    cannot be expected to work since the node already started up and upgraded the

    rest of its metadata. Since #41731 we actively reject downgrades to versions â‰¥

    v7.2.0 too.

    This commit prevents the node from starting in the presence of any too-old

    indices (closed or not). In particular, it does not write any upgraded metadata

    in this situation, increasing the chances an in-place downgrade might be

    successful. We still actively reject the downgrade using #41731, because we

    wrote the node metadata file before checking the index metadata, but at least

    there is a way to override this check.

    Relates #21830, #44230
