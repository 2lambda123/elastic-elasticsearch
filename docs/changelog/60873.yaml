  title: Remove join timeout
  anchor: remove_join_timeout
  body: |-
    There is no point in timing out a join attempt any more. Timing out and
    retrying with the same master is pointless, and an in-flight join
    attempt to one master no longer blocks attempts to join other masters.
    This commit removes this unnecessary setting.
    Relates #60872 in which this setting was deprecated.
