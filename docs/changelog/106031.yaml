deprecation:
  title: Deprecate allowing `fields` in scenarios where it is ignored
  area: Mapping
  details: The following mapped types have always ignored `fields` when using multi-fields. This deprecation makes this clearer and we will completely disallow `fields` for these mapped types in the future.
  impact: In the future, allowing to set `fields` for the following mapped types will be disallowed: `join`, `aggregate_metric_double`, `constant_keyword`.
