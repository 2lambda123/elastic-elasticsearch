  title: "[DSL] Introduce data stream global retention - Part 3"
  body: |-
    In this PR we introduce the API that will expose the global retention
    configuration and will allow users to take advantage of it.

    These APIs are protected by the dedicated introduced privileges:

    -  `manage_data_stream_global_retention` or higher, which allows all operations on the global retention configuration
    -  `monitor_data_stream_retention` or higher, which allows the retrieval of the global retention configuration

    This PR is not delivering the complete feature since the global
    retention is not used yet.
