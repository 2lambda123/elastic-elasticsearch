  body: >-
    The translog retention settings `index.translog.retention.size` and
    `index.translog.retention.age` were effectively
    [ignored](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/45868) in 7.4,
    [deprecated](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/51588) in 7.7,
    and now removed in 8.0 in favor of soft-deletes.

    Closes #50775
