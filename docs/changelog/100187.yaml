  title: The data stream lifecycle is now in Technical Preview
  body: "This marks the data stream lifecycle as available in Technical Preview. \n\
    Data streams will be able to take advantage of a built-in simplified and \nresilient\
    \ lifecycle implementation. Data streams with a configured lifecycle will\nbe\
    \ automatically rolled over and tail merged (a forcemerge implementation \nthat's\
    \ lightweight and only merges the long tail of small segments instead \nof the\
    \ whole shard). With the shard and index maintenance tasks being \nhandled automatically\
    \ to ensure optimum performance, and trade-off between\nindexing and searching,\
    \ you'll be able to focus on the business related \nlifecycle aspects like data\
    \ retention. "
