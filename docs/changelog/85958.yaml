  body: |-
    We introduce a new question answering NLP task in 8.3. This task extracts 
    the relevant section that answers a specific question from a larger context. 
    This is especially suited to search requests against large documents. You 
    can find an example of extracting an answer from a larger wiki article about 
    Tower Bridge below.
