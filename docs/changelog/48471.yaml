  body: >-
    We have a number of deprecated methods on the high-level Rest client's
    `IndicesClient` that take server-side object classes and allow users to
    passthe `include_type_name` parameter.  These all have equivalent methods
    thatuse HLRC classes instead, the only difference being the lack of the
    typesparameter.

    This commit removes these deprecated methods.
