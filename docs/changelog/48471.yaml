  body: |-
    We have a number of deprecated methods on the high-level Rest client's
    IndicesClient that take server-side object classes and allow users to pass
    the include_type_name parameter.  These all have equivalent methods that
    use HLRC classes instead, the only difference being the lack of the types
    parameter.
    This commit removes these deprecated methods.
