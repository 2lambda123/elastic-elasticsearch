summary: Remove `Client.prepareIndex(index,` type, id) method

  title: Remove `Client.prepareIndex(index,` type, id) method
  anchor: remove_client_prepareindex_index_type_id_method
  body: As types are no longer used in index requests, we can remove the type
    parameterfrom prepareIndex methods in the Client interface.  However, just
    changing the signatureof `prepareIndex(index, type, id)` to
    `prepareIndex(index, id)` risks confusion when upgrading with the previous
    (now removed) `prepareIndex(index, type)` method - just changing the
    dependency version of java code would end up silently changing the semantics
    of the method call.  Instead we should just remove this method entirely, and
    replace it by calling `prepareIndex(index).setId(id)`
