  title: Remove deprecated boolean dates
  area: Aggregations
  details: |-
    Drop support for running date aggregations on boolean fields.  We
    deprecated this a while ago, and it's basically always been a bug.  I
    would honestly be surprised if anyone was doing this, even by accident,
    but we did go through the deprecation process on it anyway.
