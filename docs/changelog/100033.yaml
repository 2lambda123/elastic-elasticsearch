summary: "[Behavioral Analytics] Analytics collections use DLM instead of ILM for\
  \ data retention management. Behavioral analytics has traditionally used ILM to \
  \ manage data retention. Starting with 8.11.0, this will change. \
  \ Analytics collections created prior to 8.11.0 will continue to use their existing \
  \ ILM policies, but new analytics collections will be managed using DLM."
