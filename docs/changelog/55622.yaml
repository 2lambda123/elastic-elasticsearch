  title: Remove `use_field_mapping` format option for docvalue fields.
  anchor: remove_use_field_mapping_format_option_for_docvalue_fields_
  body: In 7.0, we began formatting `docvalue_fields` by default using each
    field'smapping definition. To ease the transition from 6.x, we added the
    formatoption `use_field_mapping`. This parameter was deprecated in 7.0, and
    we canremove it in 8.0.
