  body: >-
    This commit finalizes the work done to rename `size` to `max_docs` inreindex
    and update/delete by query. `size` is no longer supported in URLor outer
    level body for the 3 APIs (though `size` in update/delete-by-querywill and
    has always been interpreted as `scroll_size`, it is not to be reliedupon).

    Continuation of #41894

    Closes #24344
