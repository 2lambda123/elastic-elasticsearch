  anchor: reject_misconfigured_ambiguous_ssl_server_config
  body: >-
    This commit makes it an error to start a node where either of theserver
    contexts (xpack.security.transport.ssl andxpack.security.http.ssl) meet
    either of these conditions:

    1. The server lacks a certificate/key pair (i.e. neither   ssl.keystore.path nor ssl.certificate are configured)2. The server has some ssl configuration, but ssl.enabled is not   specified. This new validation does not care whether ssl.enabled is   true or false (though other validation might), it simply makes it   an error to configure server SSL without being explicit about   whether to enable that configuration.
