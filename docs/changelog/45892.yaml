  anchor: reject_misconfigured_ambiguous_ssl_server_config
  body: |-
    This commit makes it an error to start a node where either of the
    server contexts (xpack.security.transport.ssl and
    xpack.security.http.ssl) meet either of these conditions:

    The server lacks a certificate/key pair (i.e. neither
    ssl.keystore.path nor ssl.certificate are configured)
    The server has some ssl configuration, but ssl.enabled is not
    specified. This new validation does not care whether ssl.enabled is
    true or false (though other validation might), it simply makes it
    an error to configure server SSL without being explicit about
    whether to enable that configuration.
