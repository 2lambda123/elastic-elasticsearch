  title: Cross-cluster search provides details about search on each cluster
  body: |-
    Previously with cross-cluster searches using ccs_minimize_roundtrips=true,
    when an error was returned, it was unclear which cluster caused the problem.
    We have improved the search response for both synchronous and asynchronous
    searches to have status and error details in the `_clusters` section, listing
    each cluster involved in the search by name (alias). It includes
    status info, shard accounting counts and error information that
    are updated incrementally as the search progresses. In case of errors or partial
    results, you can use this information to determine to what extent the search
    results might be usable and if any follow-up action is needed to reduce errors.

    The search on each cluster can be in one of 5 states: `RUNNING`,
    `SUCCESSFUL` (all shards were successfully searched), `PARTIAL` (some shard
    searches failed, but at least one succeeded and partial data has been returned),
    `SKIPPED` (no shards were successfully searched on a cluster marked with
    skip_unavailable=true), and `FAILED` (no shards were successfully searched on a
    cluster marked with skip_unavailable=false).

    Kibana users can access this information by viewing the search response in the Inspect flyout.
