  body: >-
    This commit completes the work to remove the listener thread pool, having
    removed all uses of it in the server codebase, and deprecated it in 7.x.
    With this commit, we also remove the infrastructgure to deprecate a fixed
    thread pool, which was added as part of this work, since it is easy to bring
    back if needed.

    Closes #53049
