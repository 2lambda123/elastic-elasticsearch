  title: "`RollupStart` endpoint should return OK if job already started"
  anchor: _rollupstart_endpoint_should_return_ok_if_job_already_started
  body: >-
    If a job is started or indexing, RollupStart should always return a success
    (200 OK) response since the job is, in fact, started

    This also removes some no-longer-needed serialization version checking on stop job (only needed for 6.x and 7.x)

    I'm not sure if this should be backported to 7.x.  It's technically a breaking change, but also one that is unlikely to be noticed.  It would only break someone if they were relying on the second invocation of the API to throw the exception so they could do something else.  Thoughts?  I also don't think this is critical, so if this is 8.0+ only that seems fine too.

    Closes https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39845 and https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/35928
