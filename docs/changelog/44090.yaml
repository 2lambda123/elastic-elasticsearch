  title: Do not set a NameID format in Policy by default
  anchor: do_not_set_a_nameid_format_in_policy_by_default
  body: >-
    This commit changes the behavior of our SAML realm to not set aFormat
    element in the NameIDPolicy of a SAML Authenticationrequest if one has not
    been explicitly configured by the userwith `nameid_format`. We select to not
    include a format, ratherthan setting it
    to`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:unspecified` which wouldhave
    the same effect, in order to maximize interoperability withIdP
    implementations. `AllowCreate` is not removed as this has adefault value
    (false) in the specification.
