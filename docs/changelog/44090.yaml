  anchor: do_not_set_a_nameid_format_in_policy_by_default
  body: |-
    This commit changes the behavior of our SAML realm to not set a
    Format element in the NameIDPolicy of a SAML Authentication
    request if one has not been explicitly configured by the user
    with nameid_format. We select to not include a format, rather
    than setting it to
    urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:unspecified which would
    have the same effect, in order to maximize interoperability with
    IdP implementations. AllowCreate is not removed as this has a
    default value (false) in the specification.
