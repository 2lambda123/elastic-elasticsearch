  anchor: remove_content_type_required_setting
  body: |-
    This change removes the HTTP content type required setting, which was
    deprecated in 6.0 and only existed for users upgrading from 5.x so that
    they did not need to remove the setting immediately. The setting has no
    effect on behavior.
