  title: Decouple shard allocation awareness from search and get requests
  anchor: decouple_shard_allocation_awareness_from_search_and_get_requests
  body: >-
    With this commit, Elasticsearch will no longer prefer using shards in the
    same location

    (with the same awareness attribute values) to process _search and _get requests.

    Instead, adaptive replica selection (the default since 7.0) should route requests more efficiently

    using the service time of prior inter-node communications. Clusters with big latencies between

    nodes should switch to cross cluster replication to isolate nodes within the same zone.

    Note that this change only targets 8.0 since it is considered as breaking. However a follow up

    pr should add an option to activate this behavior in 7.x in order to allow users to opt-in early.

    Closes #43453
