  title: Remove `index.max_adjacency_matrix_filters`
  area: Settings
  details: |
    If you configured this it was likely to raise the original value. In 8.0
    we use `indices.query.bool.max_clause_count` instead of the old setting. It
    has a much higher default so we expect most folks who overrode the setting
    will not have to do so in 8.0.
  impact: |
    If you raised `index.max_adjacency_matrix_filters` beyond
    `indices.query.bool.max_clause_count` then
    {{search-aggregations-bucket-adjacency-matrix-aggregation}} will fail for
    very large lists of filters.
