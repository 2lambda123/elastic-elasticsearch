  title: Remove feature flag for time series aggregations
  body: |-
    Make `time_series` aggregation and `rate` aggregation (on counter
    fields) available without using the time series feature flag. This
    change makes these aggregations available as tech preview.

    Currently there is no documentation about the `time_series` aggregation.
    This will be added in a followup change.
