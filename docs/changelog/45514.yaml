deprecation:
  title: Deprecations for inconsistent `xpack.security.http.ssl`
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: It is deprecated to set `client_authentication` to `none` and `verification_mode` to `certificate` or `full`.
  It is also deprecated to set `verification_mode` to `none` and `client_authentication` to `optional` or `required`.
  The above deprecated configurations are nonsensical and never worked correctly.
  impact: If `client_authentication` is `none` then `verification_mode` must be set to `none` as well.
  If `client_authentication` is `optional` or `required` then `verification_mode` must be set to `certificate` or `full`.
  Any other combinations will generate deprecation logs.
