  body: |-
    The <<redact-processor,Redact processor>> obscures text in the input document matching the given Grok patterns.
    The processor can be used to obscure Personal Identifying Information (PII)
    by configuring it to detect known patterns such as email or IP addresses.
    Text that matches a Grok pattern is replaced with a configurable string such as `<EMAIL>`
    where an email address is matched or replace all matches with the text `<REDACTED>` if preferred.
    Grok provides an extensive library of predefined patterns that can be conveniently referenced by
    the Redact processor.
