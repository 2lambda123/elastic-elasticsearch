  body: |-
    The <<redact-processor,Redact processor>> obscures portions of text in the input document
    matching the given Grok patterns. A Grok pattern is like a regular
    expression with a named capturing group: text that matches the regular
    expression is replaced with the capture name. {es} comes packaged with
    a number of useful predefined {es-repo}blob/{branch}/libs/grok/src/main/resources/patterns/ecs-v1[patterns].
    If one of those does not suit your needs, create a new pattern with a
    custom pattern definition. The <<redact-processor,Redact processor>> replaces every occurrence
    of a match. If there are multiple matches all will be replaced with the
    capture name.
