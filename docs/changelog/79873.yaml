  title: Require Java 17 for running Elasticsearch
  area: Packaging
  details: |-
    Bump the required Java version for running Elasticsearch to 17.
    Attempting to run Elasticsearch with a JRE less than 17, or setting
    `runtime.java` to a JRE less than 17 in the build will result in an
    error. We do not yet bump `minimumRuntimeVersion`. Doing so would bump
    our target Java version to 17, which is obviously only possible when
    using a Java 17 compiler. Gradle 7.2 doesn't yet support Java 17 so we
    have to wait until Gradle 7.3 is released. So for now compilation will
    still target Java 11, and we'll just enforce a Java 17 runtime at
    startup. Java 17 also has no official FIPS support so this will remove
    FIPS testing for 8.0+ versions for now. cc @elastic/es-security
