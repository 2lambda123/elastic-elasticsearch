  title: A SIMD (Neon) optimised vector distance function for Scalar Quantized int8 has been added
  body: |-
    An optimised int8 vector distance implementation for aarch64.
    The vector distance implementation outperforms Lucene's Pamana Vector
    implementation for binary comparisons by approx 5x (depending on the number
    of dimensions). It does so by means of SIMD (Neon) intrinsics compiled into a
    separate native library and link by Panama's FFI. Comparisons are performed on
    off-heap mmap'ed vector data.
