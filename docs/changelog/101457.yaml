summary: "Remove Plugin.createComponents method in favour of overload with a PluginServices object"
area: Infra/Plugins
type: breaking-java

  area: "Java API"
  title: "Plugin.createComponents method has been refactored to take a single PluginServices object"
  details: >
    Plugin.createComponents currently takes a set of different objects. This signature changes
    every time a new service is added. This changes the method to take a single PluginServices object
    that new services are added to. This will reduce API incompatibility issues when a new service
    is introduced in the future.
  impact: "All plugins will need to be refactored to override the new method to work on ES 8.12+"
  notable: false
