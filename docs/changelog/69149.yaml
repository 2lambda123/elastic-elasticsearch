  body: >-
    This commit removes support for JAVA_HOME. As we previously deprecated usage
    of JAVA_HOME to override the path for the JDK, this commit follows up by
    removing support for JAVA_HOME. Note that we do not treat JAVA_HOME being
    set as a failure, as it is perfectly reasonable for a user to have JAVA_HOME
    configured at the system level.

    Closes #55820
