  title: Reject unknown bulk actions
  area: CRUD
  details: Requests to the bulk API comprise a sequence of items, each of which
    starts with a JSON object describing the item. This object includes the
    type of action to perform with the item which should be one of `create`,
    `update`, `index`, or `delete`. In earlier versions {es} would ignore items
    with an unrecognized type, skipping the next line in the request, but this
    lenient behaviour means that there is no way for the client to associate
    the items in the response with the items in the request, and in some cases
    it would cause the remainder of the request to be parsed incorrectly.

    From version 8.5 onwards, requests to the bulk API must comprise only items
    with recognized types. {es} will reject requests containing any items with
    an unrecognized type with a `400 Bad Request` error response.
  impact: Ensure your application only sends items with type `create`,
    `update`, `index` or `delete` to the bulk API.
