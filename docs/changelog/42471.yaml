  title: Remove `SecurityClient` from x-pack
  anchor: remove_securityclient_from_x_pack
  body: This commit removes the SecurityClient class from x-pack. This clientclass
    is a relic of the transport client, which is in the process ofbeing removed.
    Some tests were changed to use the high level restclient and others use a
    client directly without the security clientwrapping it.
