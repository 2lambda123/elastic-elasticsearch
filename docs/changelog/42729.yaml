  body: |-
    This commit removes the XPackClient class from x-pack. This class is a
    relic of the TransportClient and simply a wrapper around it. Calls are
    replaced with direct usage of a client. Additionally, the
    XPackRestHandler class has been removed as it only served to provide
    the XPackClient to implementing rest handlers.
