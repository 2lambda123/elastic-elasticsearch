  title: Ingest performance improvement
  body: |-
    We have improved the pipeline execution logic for pipelines with processors that are synchronous
    by avoiding (deep) recursion.
    On our nightly benchmark that simulate a Logging use-case, this resulted in a 10% reduction of
    CPU time spent on ingest pipelines and a 3% overall ingestion speedup.
