  body: >-
    This commit removes the infrastructure for client feature tracking. We
    introduced this functionality to support clients that do not necessarily
    understand all the features that the server might support, for example,
    customs in the cluster state provided by plugins that a client might not
    have. This can arise in situations such as rolling upgrades from the OSS
    distribution to the default distribution. With the removal of the transport
    client, this infrastructure is no longer needed. This commit removes client
    feature tracking from the server in 8.0.0.
