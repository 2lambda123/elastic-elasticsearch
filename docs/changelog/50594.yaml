  title: Remove the 'local' parameter of /_cat/nodes
  anchor: remove_the_local_parameter_of_cat_nodes
  body: >-
    The cat nodes API performs a `ClusterStateAction` then a
    `NodesInfoAction`.Today it accepts the `?local` parameter and passes this to
    the`ClusterStateAction` but this parameter has no effect on the
    `NodesInfoAction`.This is surprising, because `GET _cat/nodes?local` looks
    like it might be acompletely local call but in fact it still depends on
    every node in thecluster.

    This parameter was deprecated in 7.x in #50499 and this commit removes it.

    Relates #50088
