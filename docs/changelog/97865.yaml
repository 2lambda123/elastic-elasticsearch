  title: Exclude clusters from a cross-cluster search
  body: |-
    When doing a cross-cluster search, if you use a wildcard to include a list of clusters, you
    can explicitly exclude one or more clusters with a minus sign ('-'). To exclude an entire cluster,
    put the minus sign in front of the cluster alias, such as: `remote*:*,-remote3:*,-remote5:*`.
    In that case, clusters with the alias "remote3" and "remote5" will be excluded from the search.
    For this feature, you must use `*` in the index position or an error will be returned.
