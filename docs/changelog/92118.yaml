  title: Allow more than one KNN search clause
  body: "It makes sense to allow more than one KNN search clause per individual\n\
    search request. It may be that different documents have separate vector\nspaces\
    \ or that a single doc is index with more than one vector space. In\nboth of these\
    \ scenarios, users may want to retrieve a resulting set that\ntakes into account\
    \ all their indexed vector spaces. \n\nA prime example here would be searching\
    \ a semantic text embedding along\nwith searching an image embedding. \n\ncloses\
