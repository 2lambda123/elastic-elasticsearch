  title: Remove slowlog level
  anchor: remove_slowlog_level
  body: Setting a slow log level requires an unnecessary conditional logic in
    `SearchSlowLog` and `IndexingSlowLog`The behaviour of setting a level on a
    slow logger can be achieved with correct slow log threshold settings. This
    PR is removing slow log and modifies tests to achieve the same behaviour
    with changing threshold.relates
