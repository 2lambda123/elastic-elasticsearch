  title: Reading indices from older Elasticsearch versions
  body: |-
    Elasticsearch has full query and write support for indices created in the previous major
    version. If you have indices created in Elasticsearch versions 5 or 6, you can now use
    the archive functionality to import and query these indices as well.
    The archive functionality provides slower read-only access to older data,
    for compliance or regulatory reasons, the occasional lookback or investigation,
    or to rehydrate parts of it. Access to the data is expected to be infrequent,
    and can therefore happen with limited performance and query capabilities.
