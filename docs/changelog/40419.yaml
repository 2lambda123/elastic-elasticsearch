  title: Make remote cluster resolution stricter
  anchor: make_remote_cluster_resolution_stricter
  body: >-
    Remote cluster resolution is currently lenient, to support localindices that
    may contain `:` in their name. From 8.0 on, there can nolonger be indices in
    the cluster that contain `:` in their name, hencewe can make remote cluster
    resolution stricter. Instead of treatingas local any index expression
    containing a `:` whenever there is no correspondingmatching remote cluster
    registered, we now throw a`NoSuchRemoteClusterException`.

    Closes #37863
