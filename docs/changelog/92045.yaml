  title: TSDB numeric compression
  body: |-
    This PR introduces a new doc values format meant to be used by TSDB. It
    provides compression using delta encoding, gcd encoding and bit-packing
    encoding. The expectation is that such encodings work well for numeric
    fields whose values are monotonically increasing, like the timestamp field
    and counter metric fields.
