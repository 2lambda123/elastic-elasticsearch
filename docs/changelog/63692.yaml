  title: Fix range query on date fields for number inputs
  anchor: fix_range_query_on_date_fields_for_number_inputs
  body: >-
    Currently, if you write a date range query with numeric 'to' or 'from'
    bounds,

    they can be interpreted as years if no format is provided. We use

    "strict_date_optional_time||epoch_millis" in this case that can interpret inputs

    like 1000 as the year 1000 for example. We should change this to always

    interpret and parse numbers in this case with the second option "epoch_millis"

    if no other formatter was provided.

    Closes #63680
