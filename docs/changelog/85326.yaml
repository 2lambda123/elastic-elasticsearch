  title: Deprecation notice if LDAP/AD realm is missing bind password for bind DN
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: "LDAP/AD authentication realms can be configured to
  authenticate through LDAP via a bind user. For this it's necessary to
  set a bind DN together with a bind password. Setting a bind DN
  without a bind password will cause all LDAP/AD realm authentication
  to fail. To better surface this, nodes with incomplete bind
  credentials will fail to start in the next major release.
  Documentation on how to set a bind password is available for
  [LDAP](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ldap-realm.html#ldap-realm-configuration)
  and
  [AD](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/active-directory-realm.html#ad-realm-configuration)."
  impact: In the next major release, nodes will fail to start if they have a bind DN set but are missing a bind password for LDAP/AD realms.
