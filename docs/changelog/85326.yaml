  title: Deprecate LDAP/AD realm settings missing bind password for bind DN
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: |-
    LDAP/Active Directory authentication realms can be configured to
    authenticate through LDAP via a bind user. For this it's necessary to
    set a bind DN together with a bind password. Setting a bind DN without
    a bind password will cause all LDAP/Active Directory realm
    authentication to fail. To better surface this, nodes with incomplete
    bind credentials will fail to start in the next major release.
    Documentation on how to set a bind password is available for
    [LDAP](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ldap-realm.html#ldap-realm-configuration)
    and [Active
    Directory](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/active-directory-realm.html#ad-realm-configuration).
  impact: |-
    In the next major release, nodes will fail to start if they
    have a bind DN set but are missing a bind password for LDAP/Active
    Directory realms.
