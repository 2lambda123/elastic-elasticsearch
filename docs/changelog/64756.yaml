  title: Force-merges on frozen and searchable snapshot indices will fail if merging is required.
  anchor: breaking_712_engine_forcemerge_change
  body: |-
    In earlier versions a force-merge on a frozen index or a searchable snapshot
    index would incorrectly yield a successful response without performing the
    requested merge. This bug is fixed in version 7.12: from this version onwards a
    force-merge on these immutable indices will fail if the requested merge is not
    a no-op.
