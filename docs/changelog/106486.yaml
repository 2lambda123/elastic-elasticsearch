  title: New custom parser for ISO-8601 datetimes
  body: |-
    This introduces a new custom parser for ISO-8601 datetimes, for the `iso8601`, `strict_date_optional_time`, and
    `strict_date_optional_time_nanos` built-in date formats. This provides a performance improvement over the
    default Java date-time parsing.

  title: Some invalid ISO-8601 datetime strings will no longer be accepted
  details: |-
    A new parser has been introduced for the `iso8601`, `strict_date_optional_time`, and
    `strict_date_optional_time_nanos` built-in date formats. This parser no longer accepts
    nonsensical date-time strings that have multiple fractional seconds fields or multiple timezone specifiers.
    These strings are not valid according to ISO-8601, and the parsing behaviour of such strings was undefined.
  impact: |-
    If your ingest data contains such invalid strings, they will be rejected as invalid date strings
