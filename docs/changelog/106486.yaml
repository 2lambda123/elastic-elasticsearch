  title: New custom parser for ISO-8601 datetimes
  body: |-
    This introduces a new custom parser for ISO-8601 datetimes, for the `iso8601`, `strict_date_optional_time`, and
    `strict_date_optional_time_nanos` built-in date formats. This provides a performance improvement over the
    default Java date-time parsing. Note that this will cause some nonsensical date-time values
    (those with multiple fractional seconds fields, or with multiple timezones) that were previously accepted
    to be rejected as invalid.
