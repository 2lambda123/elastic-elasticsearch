deprecation:
  title: Legacy values for the `discovery.type` setting are deprecated
  area: Cluster and node setting
  notable: true
  details: |-
    Legacy values for the `discovery.type` setting are deprecated and will be
    forbidden in a future version.
  impact: |-
    Do not set `discovery.type` to any value except `single-node` or `multi-node`.
    All other values are equivalent to the default discovery type which is
    `multi-node`. Where possible, omit this setting so that {es} uses the default
    discovery type.
