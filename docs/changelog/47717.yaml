  title: Remove `include_relocations` setting
  anchor: remove_include_relocations_setting
  body: "Setting `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.include_relocations` to `false`
    is abad idea since it will lead to the kinds of overshoot that were
    otherwise fixedin #46079. This setting was deprecated in #47443. This commit
    removes it."
