    This PR is a followup to
    https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/44691. It disables the
    possibility to update job_id on a datafeed.DatafeedUpdate.jobId field can be
    set in the _update request as long as it is the same as the current value of
    DatafeedConfig.jobId.

    Closes https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44616
