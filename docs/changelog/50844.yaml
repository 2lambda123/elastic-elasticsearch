  anchor: remove_type_parameter_from_putmappingrequest_buildfromsimplifieddef_
  body: >-
    Mappings built by this method should all be wrapped with _doc, so there's no
    need

    to pass the type any more.  This also renames the method to simpleMapping, in line

    with CreateIndexRequest, to help migration by causing compilation errors; and changes

    the signature to take a String... rather than an Object....

    Relates to #41059
