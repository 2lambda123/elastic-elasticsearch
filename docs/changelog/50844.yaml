  body: >-
    Mappings built by this method should all be wrapped with `_doc`, so there's
    no needto pass the type any more.  This also renames the method to
    `simpleMapping`, in linewith `CreateIndexRequest`, to help migration by
    causing compilation errors; and changesthe signature to take a `String...`
    rather than an `Object...`.

    Relates to #41059
