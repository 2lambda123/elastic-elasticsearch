  title: Deprecate updating replica count with auto-expand
  area: Distributed
  body: |-
    Today if you update `index.number_of_replicas` on indices that have
    `index.auto_expand_replicas` set then the update is accepted but
    silently ignored. Lenience like this is surprising. This commit
    deprecates this behaviour so that it can be removed in a future release.

    Relates #27835
