  body: >-
    This setting, which prior to Elasticsearch 5 was enabled by default and
    caused all kinds of confusion, has [since been disabled by
    default](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/19964) and is not
    recommended for production use. The prefered way going forward is for users
    to explicitly specify separate data folders for each started node to ensure
    that each node is consistently assigned to the same data path.

    A follow-up will move the default data path from `${data.paths}/nodes/0` to `${data.paths}`

    Relates to #42426
