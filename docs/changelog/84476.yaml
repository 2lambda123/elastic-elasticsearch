  title: Deprecation for truststores with no trust entries
  area: Security
  body: |-
    The use of SSL truststores that do not contain any trusted entries has been deprecated.
    The various `*.ssl.truststore.path` settings (for example
    `xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path` or `xpack.http.ssl.truststore.path`) can
    be used to configure a set of "trust anchors" for SSL certificate verification. In {es}
    version 7 and earlier, it was permitted to configure a truststore that did not contain
    any trust anchors (that is, it was empty, or it contained "private key" entries only).
    In {es} version 8 and above, a `truststore.path` without any trusted certificate entries
    is no longer accepted, and will cause an error. This configuration is now deprecated in
    {es} version 7.17
