summary: Bulk actions JSON must be well-formed
deprecation:
  title: Lenient parsing of bulk actions is deprecated
  area: REST API
  notable: true
  details: |-
    Older versions of {es} parse the action lines of bulk requests very permissively
    and would silently ignore invalid or malformed actions. This lenience is
    deprecated and a future version will reject bulk requests containing invalid
    actions.
  impact: |-
    Ensure that bulk actions are well-formed JSON objects containing a single entry
    with the correct key.
