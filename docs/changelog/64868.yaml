  title: Remove the deprecated local parameter for _cat/indices
  anchor: remove_the_deprecated_local_parameter_for_cat_indices
  body: >-
    The cat indices API performs several actions including an
    `IndicesStatsAction`. Today it accepts the `?local` parameter and passes it
    to the actions that support it but this parameter has no effect on the
    `IndicesStatsAction`. This can be surprising because `GET
    _cat/indices?local` looks like it might be a completely local call but in
    fact it still depends on every node in the cluster.

    The `local` parameter was deprecated in 7.x and this commit removes it for 8.x.
