  title: Doc-values-only search on numeric, `date`, `keyword`, `ip`, and `boolean` fields
  body: |-
    You can now run `term` and `range` queries on numeric, `date`, `date_nanos`,
    `keyword`, `ip`, and `boolean` fields that only store doc values.

    In exchange for slower queries, doc-value-only fields offer:

    * Increased indexing rates
    * Better storage efficiency
    * Great performance for aggregating and sorting data

    For more information about doc values, refer to the
    {ref}/doc-values.html[`doc_values` mapping parameter documentation].
