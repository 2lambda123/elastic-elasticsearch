  title: Doc-values-only search is now supported on numeric, date, keyword, ip, and boolean types
  body: |-
    Doc-value-only fields allow users to trade slower query performance for
    an increased indexing rate and storage space efficiency. This is
    achieved by disabling inverted structures such as the inverted index or
    points, and using the columnar storage format of doc values to run
    queries instead, while still providing the same usual great performance
    for aggregating and sorting data. {es} {version} supports term and
    range queries on `numeric`, `date`, `keyword`, `ip`, and `boolean`
    doc-value-only field types.
