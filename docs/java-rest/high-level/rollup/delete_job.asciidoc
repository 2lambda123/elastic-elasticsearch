=== Delete Rollup Job API

The Delete Rollup Job API can be used to delete an existing Rollup job
in the cluster. The API accepts a `PutRollupJobRequest` object
as a request and returns a `PutRollupJobResponse`.

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-rollup-delete-rollup-job-request]]
==== Delete Rollup Job Request

A `DeleteRollupJobRequest` requires the following argument:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/RollupDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-rollup-delete-rollup-job-request]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-rollup-delete-rollup-job-execution]]
==== Execution

The Delete Rollup Job API can be executed through a `RollupClient`
instance. Such instance can be retrieved from a `RestHighLevelClient`
using the `rollup()` method:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/RollupDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-rollup-delete-rollup-job-execute]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-rollup-delete-rollup-job-execution-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

This request can be executed asynchronously:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/RollupDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-rollup-delete-rollup-job-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `DeleteRollupJobRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for `DeleteRollupJobResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/RollupDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-rollup-delete-rollup-job-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-rollup-delete-rollup-job-response]]
==== Response

The returned `DeleteRollupJobResponse` indicates if the delete command was received:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/RollupDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-rollup-delete-rollup-job-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> `acknowledged` is a boolean indicating whether the delete command was received
