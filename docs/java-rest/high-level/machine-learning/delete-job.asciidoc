=== Delete Job API

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-machine-learning-delete-job-request]]
==== Delete Job Request

A `DeleteJobRequest` object requires a non-null `jobId` and can optionally set `force`.
Can be executed as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
---------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MachineLearningDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-delete-machine-learning-job-request]
---------------------------------------------------
<1> Use to forcefully delete an opened job;
this method is quicker than closing and deleting the job.
Defaults to `false`

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-machine-learning-delete-job-response]]
==== Delete Job Response

The returned `DeleteJobResponse` object indicates the acknowledgement of the request:
["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
---------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MachineLearningDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-delete-machine-learning-job-response]
---------------------------------------------------
<1> `isAcknowledged` was the deletion request acknowledged or not

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-machine-learning-delete-job-async]]
==== Delete Job Asynchronously

This request can also be made asynchronously.
["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
---------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MachineLearningDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-delete-machine-learning-job-request-async]
---------------------------------------------------
<1> The `DeleteJobRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to alert on completion or error.

The deletion request returns immediately. Once the request is completed, the `ActionListener` is
called back using the `onResponse` or `onFailure`. The latter indicates some failure occurred when
making the request.

A typical listener for a `DeleteJobRequest` could be defined as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
---------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MachineLearningDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-delete-machine-learning-job-request-listener]
---------------------------------------------------
<1> The action to be taken when it is completed
<2> What to do when a failure occurs
