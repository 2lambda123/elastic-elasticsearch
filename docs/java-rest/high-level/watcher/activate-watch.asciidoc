=== Activate Watch API

[[java-rest-high-watcher-activate-watch-execution]]
==== Execution

A watch can be activated as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/WatcherDocumentationIT.java[activate-watch-execute]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-watcher-activate-watch-response]]
==== Response

The returned `ActivateWatchResponse` contains the new status of the activated watch.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/WatcherDocumentationIT.java[activate-watch-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> `watchStatus` contains status of the watch

[[java-rest-high-watcher-activate-watch-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

This request can be executed asynchronously:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/WatcherDocumentationIT.java[activate-watch-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `ActivateWatchRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for `ActivateWatchResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/WatcherDocumentationIT.java[activate-watch-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument
