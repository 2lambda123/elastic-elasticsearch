== Using Java Builders

The Java High Level REST Client depends on the Elasticsearch core project which provides
two types of Java `Builders` objects:

Query Builders::

The query builders are used to create `QueryBuilder` objects which can later be set as the
query parameter of `SearchSourceBuilder` objects. The <<java-rest-high-document-search-request-building-queries, Search Request>>
page shows an example of how to build a full search request using `SearchSourceBuilder` and
`QueryBuilder` objects. The <<java-rest-high-query-builders, Building Search Queries>> page
gives a list of all available search queries with their corresponding `QueryBuilder` objects and
`QueryBuilders` helper methods.

Aggregation Builders::

Similarly to query builders, the aggregation builders are used to create `AggregationBuilder` objects
which can later be set as the aggregation parameter of `SearchSourceBuilder` objects. There is a example
of how `AggregationBuilder` objects are used with `SearchSourceBuilder` objects to define the aggregations
to compute with a search query in <<java-rest-high-document-search-request-building-aggs, Search Request>> page.
The <<java-rest-high-aggregation-builders, Building Aggregations>> page gives a list of all available
aggregations with their corresponding `AggregationBuilder` objects and `AggregationBuilders` helper methods.
