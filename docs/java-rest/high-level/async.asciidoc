==== Asynchronous Execution

Executing a +{request}+ can also be done in an asynchronous fashion so that
the client can return directly. Users need to specify how the response or
potential failures will be handled by passing the request and a listeners to the
asynchronous search method:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SearchDocumentationIT.java[search-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `SearchRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for `SearchResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SearchDocumentationIT.java[search-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed.
<2> Called when the whole `SearchRequest` fails.
