=== Start Basic License

[[java-rest-high-post-start-basic-execution]]
==== Execution

The basic license can be started using the `postStartBasic()` method:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/LicensingDocumentationIT.java[post-start-basic-execute]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-post-start-basic-response]]
==== Response

The returned `PostStartBasicResponse` contains the `acknowledged` flag and possible acknowledge messages.
The acknowledge messages are present if you unable to initiate a basic license and you didn't set
the `acknowledge` flag to `true`.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/LicensingDocumentationIT.java[post-start-basic-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Check the acknowledge flag. It should be true if start is acknowledged.
<2> Otherwise we can see the acknowledge messages in `acknowledgeMessage()`
<3> and check component-specific messages in `acknowledgeMessages()`.
<4> Error message or `null` if there is no error.

[[java-rest-high-post-start-basic-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

This request can be executed asynchronously:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/LicensingDocumentationIT.java[post-start-basic-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `PostStartBasicResponse` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for `PostStartBasicResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/LicensingDocumentationIT.java[post-start-basic-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument
