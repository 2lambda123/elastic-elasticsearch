=== Set Upgrade Mode API

The Set Upgrade Mode API provides the ability stop all {ml} job and {dfeed} tasks
from executing.

It accepts a +{request}+ object and responds
with a +{response}+ object.

When `enabled=true`, no new jobs can be opened, and no job or {dfeed} tasks will
be running. Be sure to set `enabled=false` once upgrade actions are completed.
