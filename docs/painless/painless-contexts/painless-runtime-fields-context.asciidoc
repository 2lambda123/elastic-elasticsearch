[[painless-runtime-fields-context]]
=== Runtime fields context
beta::[]
Use a Painless script to calculate and emit
<<painless-runtime-fields,runtime field>> values.

See the {ref}/runtime.html[runtime fields] documentation for more information
about how to use runtime fields.

*Variables*

`params` (`Map`, read-only)::
        User-defined parameters passed in as part of the query.

`doc` (`Map`, read-only)::
        Contains the fields of the specified document where each field is a
        `List` of values.

{ref}/mapping-source-field.html[`params['_source']`] (`Map`, read-only)::
        Contains extracted JSON in a `Map` and `List` structure for the fields
        existing in a stored document.

*Return*

`void`::
        No expected return value.

*API*

Both the standard <<painless-api-reference-shared, Painless API>> and
<<painless-api-reference-field, Specialized Field API>> are available.


*Example*

Let's break down each of the steps from the
<<painless-context-examples,context examples>> to understand how runtime fields
work within the context of Painless.

[[painless-runtime-fields-mappings]]
==== Create the index mappings
First, create the mappings for the sample data:

[source,console]
----
PUT /seats
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "theatre":  { "type": "keyword" },
      "play":     { "type": "keyword" },
      "actors":   { "type": "text"    },
      "row":      { "type": "integer" },
      "number":   { "type": "integer" },
      "cost":     { "type": "double"  },
      "sold":     { "type": "boolean" },
      "datetime": { "type": "date"    },
      "date":     { "type": "keyword" },
      "time":     { "type": "keyword" }
    }
  }
}
----

[[painless-runtime-fields-processor]]
==== Run the ingest processor
Next, run the request from the <<painless-ingest-processor-context,Painless ingest processor context>> to configure a script ingest processor that parses
each document as the `seat` data is indexed:

[source,console]
----
PUT /_ingest/pipeline/seats
{
  "description": "update datetime for seats",
  "processors": [
    {
      "script": {
        "source": "String[] dateSplit = ctx.date.splitOnToken('-'); String year = dateSplit[0].trim(); String month = dateSplit[1].trim(); if (month.length() == 1) { month = '0' + month; } String day = dateSplit[2].trim(); if (day.length() == 1) { day = '0' + day; } boolean pm = ctx.time.substring(ctx.time.length() - 2).equals('PM'); String[] timeSplit = ctx.time.substring(0, ctx.time.length() - 2).splitOnToken(':'); int hours = Integer.parseInt(timeSplit[0].trim()); int minutes = Integer.parseInt(timeSplit[1].trim()); if (pm) { hours += 12; } String dts = year + '-' + month + '-' + day + 'T' + (hours < 10 ? '0' + hours : '' + hours) + ':' + (minutes < 10 ? '0' + minutes : '' + minutes) + ':00+08:00'; ZonedDateTime dt = ZonedDateTime.parse(dts, DateTimeFormatter.ISO_OFFSET_DATE_TIME); ctx.datetime = dt.getLong(ChronoField.INSTANT_SECONDS)*1000L;"
      }
    }
  ]
}

[[painless-runtime-fields-ingest]]
==== Ingest some sample data
Use the ingest pipeline you defined to ingest some sample data. You
can ingest the full https://download.elastic.co/demos/painless/contexts/seats.json[seat sample data], but we'll only use a subset for this example:

[source,console]
----
POST seats/_bulk?pipeline=seats&refresh=true

[[painless-runtime-fields-definition]]
==== Define a runtime field with a Painless script
Run the following request to define a runtime field named `day_of_week`. This
field contains a script with the same `source` defined in
<<painless-field-context,Field context>>, but also uses an `emit` function
that runtime fields require when defining a Painless script.

Because `day_of_week` is a runtime field, it isn't indexed, and the included
script only runs at query time:

[source,console]
----
PUT seats/_mapping
{
  "runtime": {
    "day_of_week": {
      "type": "keyword",
      "script": {
        "source": "emit(doc['datetime'].value.getDayOfWeekEnum().toString())"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
// TEST[continued]

After defining the runtime field and script in the mappings, you can run a
query that includes a terms aggregation for `day_of_week`. When the query runs,
{es} evaluates the included Painless script and dynamically generates a value
based on the script definition:

[source,console]
----
GET seats/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "fields": [
    "time",
    "day_of_week"
    ],
    "aggs": {
      "day_of_week": {
        "terms": {
          "field": "day_of_week",
          "size": 10
        }
      }
    }
}
----
// TEST[continued]

The response includes `day_of_week` for each hit. {es} calculates the value for
this field dynamically at search time by operating on the `datetime` field
defined in the mappings.

[source,console-result]
----
{
  ...
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 10,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "day_of_week" : {
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound" : 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count" : 0,
      "buckets" : [
        {
          "key" : "THURSDAY",
          "doc_count" : 4
        },
        {
          "key" : "TUESDAY",
          "doc_count" : 4
        },
        {
          "key" : "MONDAY",
          "doc_count" : 1
        },
        {
          "key" : "SUNDAY",
          "doc_count" : 1
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
