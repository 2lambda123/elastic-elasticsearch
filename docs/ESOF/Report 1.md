Introduction
-------------
Elasticsearch is a distributed, document-oriented search server based on the open-source information retrieval library Lucene.

There are currently 1,101 open issues, 7,288 closed ones, 170 open pull requests and 5,341 closed ones.

Project Methodology
-------------------
Elasticsearch employs a development model similar to other open source projects, in which a large number of motivated developers all over the world contribute on the features they want implemented. As such, there is no clear precedence in the various tasks that are undertaken, resulting in great degree of concurrency in the project, thus diverging greatly from the waterfall model. 

In contrast, the constant adding of new features, pushed exclusively by the users of the software, and the ever expanding requirements for increasingly complex use cases, originating from large and small clients alike, invariably drive the developers to rethink and restructure both their software and their understanding of the problem at hand, bringing the project more in line with more modern methodologies.

Its nature as a distributed piece of software mandates a high level of control and correctness in the program, and the developers fulfill this requirement with a comprehensive suite of tests each patch must pass in order to be accepted and integrated.

Unlike most other other open source projects, however, their resources allow them to meet in person a few times a year, which allows for a higher degree of coordination and focus.

This paradigm allows the developers to stay invested in the project while empowering them with the flexibility to shape it to meet the diverse needs of a fast growing market that now includes some of the biggest software companies in the world such as Facebook.
