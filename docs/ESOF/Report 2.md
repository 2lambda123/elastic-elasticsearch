ESOF - Second Report
====================

Its nature as a distributed search engine and data storage system requires as a main feature that the various shards that comprise the document be distributed between various machines or nodes. Its touted high availability necessitates that the various shards be constantly communicating with each other, ready to appropriately respond to a variety of failures in the different nodes.

Both the growing need for high throughput and the need for reliability are fulfilled by the redundancy in the replicated shards housed in the nodes.

Requirements:
* Data Storage
* High Availability
* High Throughput/Real Time Performance
* High Flexibility in queries/data
* Reliability
* Developer Friendliness
* Analytics
* Distributed
* Full Text Search
