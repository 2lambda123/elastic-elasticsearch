== Creating an {es} plugin

{es} plugins are modular bits of code that add functionality to
{es}. Plugins are written in Java and implement Java interfaces that
are defined in the source code. Plugins are composed of JAR files and metadata
files, compressed in a single zip file.

There are two ways to create a plugin, depending on the type of plugin you wish
to create:

<<creating-text-analysis-plugins>>::
Text analysis plugins provide Elasticsearch with custom Lucene analyzers, token
filters, character filters, and tokenizers.

<<creating-non-text-analysis-plugins>>::
Plugins that provide custom authentication, authorization, or scoring
mechanisms, for example.
