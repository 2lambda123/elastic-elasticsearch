== Mapping Plugins

Mapping plugins come in two flavors:

. Mapper plugins allow new field datatypes to be added to Elasticsearch.
. The Mapping Transform Script plugin adds a `transform` script to the mappings
that can be used as a super `copy_to`.

=== Core mapping plugins

The core mapper plugins are:

https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments[Mapper Attachments Type plugin]::

Integrates http://lucene.apache.org/tika/[Apache Tika] to provide a new field
type `attachment` to allow indexing of documents such as PDFs and Microsoft
Word.

<<mapper-size>>::

The mapper-size plugin provides the `_size` meta field which, when enabled,
indexes the size in bytes of the original
{ref}/mapping-source-field.html[`_source`] field.

<<mapper-murmur3>>::

The mapper-murmur3 plugin allows hashes to be computed at index-time and stored
in the index for later use with the `cardinality` aggregation.

<<mapping-transform-script>>::

The Mapping Transform Script plugin adds a scripted transform phase to
that allows you to index data differently then it is stored in the `_source`.
