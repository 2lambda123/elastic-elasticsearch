NOTE: This API does not stop replication by a following index. If you use this
API targeting a follower index that is still actively following, the following
index will add back retention leases on the leader. The only purpose of this API
is to handle the case of failure to remove the following retention leases after
the <<ccr-post-unfollow,unfollow API>> is invoked.
