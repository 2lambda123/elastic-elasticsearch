/**
 * This class holds the timing breakdown for a single "node" in the query tree.  A node's
 * time may be composed of several internal attributes (rewriting, weighting, scoring, etc).
 *
 * This class holds the total accumulated time in the `timings` array, and uses the `scratch`
 * array to hold temporary data.  This is necessary, since a single node may start a timing
 * in one context (e.g. normalize), then start a new time under a different context (weight).
 * Since both of these timings are still "open", they need to be stored separately and able
 * to close independently
 *
 * This wrapper class is also serializable and ToXContent, so it is used directly in the
 * response element
