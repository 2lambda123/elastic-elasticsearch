## Logstash Bridge

This package contains bridge functionality and API-stability tests to ensure that Logstash's Elastic Integration plugin has access to the minimal subset of Elasticsearch to perform its functions.

If a change is introduced in a separate project that causes this project to fail, please consult with members of @elastic/logstash to chart a path forward.
