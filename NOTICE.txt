============
	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\index\mapper\BaseSuggestFieldMapper.java
		Suggest field mapper for handling of pre-parse/parse/post-parse state; this is helpful to identify those suggestion fields for which the mapping is defined but indexed document does not have instance of the said suggest field.

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\index\mapper\FilteredSuggestFieldMapper.java
		To parse the mapping information given for the filter suggest field and parsing the Suggest Field values at Index time.

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\common\SuggestFieldFilterIdGenerator.java
		Maintains identifiers for every filter field across hierarchy.

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\search\suggest\filteredsuggest\FilteredSuggestSuggester.java

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\search\suggest\filteredsuggest\filter\FilteredSuggestCategoryFilterMapping.java
		Used to define Query Context for Category filter that may used in conjunction with a suggester.

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\search\suggest\filteredsuggest\filter\FilteredSuggestCategoryQueryContext.java
		Used to define a Category filter that may used in conjunction with a suggester.

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\search\suggest\filteredsuggest\filter\FilteredSuggestFilterValueGenerator.java
		Generates all possible filter value combinations required for the Category filter.

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\search\suggest\filteredsuggest\filter\FilteredSuggestFilterValues.java
		Abstract Class for generating possible filter value combinations required for the Category filter.

	core\src\test\java\org\elasticsearch\search\suggest\filteredsuggest\filter\FilteredSuggestFilterMappingTests.java
		Tests to Test Filtered Suggesters Filter Mapping

	core\src\main\java\org\apache\lucene\search\suggest\document\FilteredSuggestField.java

Modified Files:
===============
	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\indices\IndicesModule.java
		Configures classes and services that are shared by indices on each node, added a filtered suggest field mapper
	
	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\search\SearchModule.java
		Sets up things that can be done at search time like queries, aggregations, and suggesters; registered filtered suggester.
	
	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\search\suggest\Suggest.java
		Top level suggest result, containing the result for each suggestion; added handling for FilteredSuggestSuggestion type.
	
	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\search\suggest\completion\context\ContextMapping.java
		Adjusted Category and geo enums for storing type names.
		
	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\index\mapper\Mapper.java
		Changes to hold the Suggest Field Id Generator under ParseContext.

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\index\mapper\Mapping.java
		To identify the BaseSuggestFieldMapper from root field mapper.

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\index\mapper\ParseContext.java
		Changes to include child reference in the document.

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\index\mapper\DocumentParser.java
		Changes to execute the BaseSuggestFieldMappers pre and post Mapper functions.

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\index\mapper\DocumentMapperParser.java
		Changes to instantiate the Suggest Field Id Generator.

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\index\codec\PerFieldMappingPostingFormatCodec.java
		Added Handling for fetching the Postings format for FilteredSuggest Field.

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\search\suggest\completion\CompletionSuggester.java
		Made the TopDocumentCollector inner class public, so that the collector can be reused in FilteredSuggest as well.

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\search\suggest\completion\FuzzyOptions.java
		Made the fuzzy option constant, parse method and constructor public, so that the same can be used for filtered auto suggest. 

	core\src\main\java\org\elasticsearch\search\suggest\completion\RegexOptions.java
		Made the regx option constant, parse method and constructor public, so that the same can be used for filtered auto suggest.
