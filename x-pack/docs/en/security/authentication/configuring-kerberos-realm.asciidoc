=== Configuring a Kerberos realm

Kerberos is used to protect services and uses a ticket-based authentication
protocol to authenticate users.
You can configure {es} to use the Kerberos V5 authentication protocol, which is 
an industry standard protocol, to authenticate users.
In this scenario, clients must present Kerberos tickets for authentication.

In Kerberos, users authenticate with an authentication service and later
with a ticket granting service to generate a TGT (ticket-granting ticket).
This ticket is then presented to the service for authentication.
Refer to your Kerberos installation documentation for more information about 
obtaining TGT. {es} clients must first obtain a TGT then initiate the process of 
authenticating with {es}.

For a summary of Kerberos terminology, see {stack-ov}/kerberos-realm.html[Kerberos authentication].

==== Requirements

. Kerberos Deployment
+
--
You must have Kerberos infrastructure setup in your environment.

NOTE: Kerberos requires a lot of external services to function properly
like time synchronization between all machines, a working forward and
reverse DNS mappings in your domain. Please refer to your Kerberos
documentation for more details.

Setting up and configuration of Kerberos deployment is out of scope for
this document. This document uses MIT Kerberos V5 as reference
implementation.

For more information,

See http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/index.html[MIT Kerberos documentation]
--

. Java GSS Requirements
+
--

{es} uses Java GSS framework support for Kerberos authentication.
To support Kerberos authentication {es} needs following:

- _krb5.conf_ Kerberos configuration file

- _keytab_ keytab containing credentials for {es} service principal

The configuration requirements depend on your Kerberos setup and you
need to refer to your Kerberos documentation to configure _krb5.conf_.

For more information on Java GSS, see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/security/kerberos-requirements1.htm[Java GSS Kerberos requirements]
--

==== Create a Kerberos realm

Following are the steps to enable Kerberos realm:

. Enable SSL/TLS for HTTP
+
--

If your {es} cluster is operating in production mode, then you must
configure the HTTP interface to use SSL/TLS before you can enable
Kerberos authentication.

For more information, see
{ref}/configuring-tls.html#tls-http[Encrypting HTTP Client Communications].

--

. Configure JVM with Kerberos configuration file
+
--

`krb5.conf` is the Kerberos configuration file. {es} uses Java GSS and
JAAS Krb5LoginModule to support Kerberos authentication using Spnego
mechanism. This configuration file provides information like default realm,
KDC and other configurations required for Kerberos authentication.
When JVM needs some configuration properties it tries to find those values
by locating and loading this file. JVM system property to configure the
file path is `java.security.krb5.conf` and to configure JVM system properties
see {ref}/jvm-options.html[configuring jvm options]. If this system property
is not specified then java tries to locate the file based on the conventions.
It is recommended that this system property be configured for {es}.
Depending on your Kerberos infrastructure you will need to configure
appropriate settings. Refer to your Kerberos documentation for more
details.

For more information, see http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html[krb5.conf]

--

. Create Keytab for service node
+
--

{es} uses secret key from the configured keytab to decrypt the tickets
presented by the user. You will need to create keytab for {es} using tools
provided by your Kerberos implementation. For example, `ktpass.exe` on
Windows or `kadmin` for MIT Kerberos are some tools that can be used
for creation of keytabs. Place this keytab file in the `ES_PATH_CONF`.
Make sure that this keytab file has read permissions. As this file contains
credentials appropriate measures must be taken to protect it.

IMPORTANT: On every {es} node, there must be a keytab file for HTTP
principal. The keytab files are unique for each node as they include the
hostname. Usually it will be of format `HTTP/es.domain.local@ES.DOMAIN.LOCAL`
{es} node can act as any principal a client requests as long as that
principal and its credentials are found in the configured keytab.

--

. Create realm
+
--

Kerberos authentication is enabled by configuring a Kerberos realm
within the authentication chain for {es}.

NOTE: You can only have one Kerberos realm configured on a {es} node.

To configure Kerberos realm, there are few mandatory realm settings and
other optional settings that you need to configure in `elasticsearch.yml`
configuration file. Add realm configuration of type `kerberos` under
the `xpack.security.authc.realms` namespace.

Most common configuration for Kerberos realm is as follows:

[source, yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.authc.realms.kerb1:
  type: kerberos
  order: 3
  keytab.path: es.keytab
  remove_realm_name: false
------------------------------------------------------------

The `username` is extracted from the ticket presented by user and usually
is of format `username@REALM`. This `username` can then be used for mapping
roles to the user. There is a realm setting `remove_realm_name` which when
set to `true` removes the realm part (`@REALM`) and the resultant
`username` can then be used for role mapping.

For detailed information of available realm settings,
see {ref}/security-settings.html#ref-kerberos-settings[Kerberos realm settings].

--

. Restart {es}

. Map roles to Kerberos user
+
--

The `kerberos` realm enables you to map Kerberos users to the roles.
This role mapping can be configured via the
{ref}/security-api-role-mapping.html[role-mapping API] or by using a file
stored on each node. You identify user by its `username` field.

The following example maps `user@REALM` to roles `monitoring`, `user`.

Configured via the role-mapping API:
[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _xpack/security/role_mapping/kerbrolemapping
{
  "roles" : [ "monitoring_user" ],
  "enabled": true,
  "rules" : {
    "field" : { "username" : "user@REALM" }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
