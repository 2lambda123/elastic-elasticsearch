=== JWT Authentication

{es} can be configured to support user authentication using externally issued _JSON Web Tokens_ (JWTs).

The JWT realm is intended for uses cases where an external service generates
JSON Web Tokens, and {es} should trust these JWTs as an authentication credential.

A common scenario that leads to this use case is where a front-end application uses
Open ID Connect (OIDC) as an authentication method, and then accesses {es} on
behalf of the logged in user.

NOTE: {es} provides a <<oidc-realm,OpenID Connect realm>> as well as the JWT realm. The `oidc` realm
provides stronger security guarantees and should be preferred for any use case where {es} is able to act
as an OIDC _Relying Party_ (RP). In particular the `oidc` realm is the only supported way to enable OpenID
Connect authentication in Kibana.

TIP: If the front-end application does not exist, use `access` tokens instead. See <<token-authentication-services>>.
     Other bearer token options are available if accessing {es} directly, without a front-end application.
     JWT realm is for when that front-end application already exists, and you want to integration that
     front-end application with {es}.

A simple JWT realm configuration is as follows:

[source, yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.authc.realms.jwt.jwt1:
  order: 3 <1>
  allowed_issuer: "https://issuer.example.com/jwt/" <2>
  allowed_audiences: [ "https://app.example.net/" ]
  allowed_signature_algorithms: [RS256] <3>
  pkc_jwkset_path: example.jwkset
  claims.principal: sub <4>
  client_authentication.type: shared_secret <5>
------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The realm `order` controls the order in which the configured realms are checked
    when authenticating a user.
<2> The `allowed_issuer` and `allowed_audiences` settings are described below in
    <<jwt-validation>>
 <3> The `allowed_signature_algorithms` and `pkc_jwkset_path` settings are
    described below in <<jws-signature-validation>>
<4> The `claims.principal` setting is described below in <<jwt-authorization>>
<5> The `client_authentication.type` setting is described below in <<client-authentication>>
[[external-workflow-requirements]]
==== External Workflow Requirements

Consider workflows that are completely separate from {es}.
They can be Open ID Connect, bespoke, or other, as long as they use JWS JWTs for an `identification token`.
In those workflows, end-users interact with a third-party application, and authenticate via a third-party authentication application.

Different tokens are created within those workflows for authentication, authorization, and identification.
Reusing the authentication or authorization tokens outside of those workflows may not be desirable.
However, reusing the `identification token` is possible.

JWT realm allows reusing the `identification token` for {es} authentication and authorization.
JWT format is similar to Open ID Connect (OIDC) ID Tokens, with some differences. See <<jwt-validation>>.

[[jwt-authentication-requirements]]
==== JWT Authentication Requirements

When a JWT realm is used for authentication into {es}, a distinction is made between the
_client_ that is connecting to {es}, and the _end-user_ on whose behalf the request should execute.
The JWT identifies the user, but a separate credential must be used to authenticate the client itself.

See <<client-authentication>> and <<jwt-validation>>.

[[jwt-client-authentication]]
==== Client authentication

Client authentication is one of two credentials required by JWT realms.
See <<jwt-validation>> for the other credential.

JWT realms support two client authentication settings: `shared_secret` and `none`.

IMPORTANT: Client authentication is enabled by default in JWT realms.

If client authentication type is `shared_secret`, the client is authenticated
using a HTTP request header that must match a pre-configured secret value.
The client must provide this shared secret with every request in the `ES-Client-Authentication` header.
The value must be a case-insensitive match to the realm's <<secure-settings,secure setting>>.
 `client_authentication.shared_secret`.
See <<ref-jwt-settings>>.

If client authentication type is `none`, the request header `ES-Client-Authentication` is ignored.

WARNING: Disabling client authentication is possible, but strongly discouraged.

[[jwt-validation]]
==== JWT validation

JWT validation is one of two credentials required by JWT realms.
See <<client-authentication>> for the other credential.

The supported JWT encoding is JSON Web Signature (JWS).
See <<jws-header-validation>> and <<jws-signature-validation>>.

The supported JWT payload is an OIDC ID Token claims set. See <<jwt-claims-set-validation>>.

[[jws-header-validation]]
==== JWS header validation

Values `alg` and `typ` are validated using OIDC ID Token validation rules.

TIP: `alg` is required. `alg` must be allowed in JWT realm settings.

See `allowed_signature_algorithms` in <<ref-jwt-settings>>.

[[jwt-claims-set-validation]]
==== JWT claims set validation

OIDC ID Token claims `iss`, `aud`, `sub`, `iat`, `exp`, `nbf`, and `auth_time` are validated using OIDC ID Token validation rules.

TIP: `iss`, `aud`, `iat`, and `exp` are required. `iss` and `aud` must be allowed in JWT realm settings.

IMPORTANT: `nonce` claim is ignored; it is only applicable inside an OIDC workflow, not application to JWT realm.

Elasticsearch claims `principal`, `groups`, `name`, `mail`, and `dn` are validated using {es} validation rules.
Regular expression settings may be used.

See <<ref-jwt-settings>>.

[[jws-signature-validation]]
==== JWS signature validation

Signatures are validated using JWS (JSON Web Signature) validation rules.

[[jwt-authorization]]
==== JWT Realm Authorization

JWT realm authorization supports role mapping API or delegated authorization realms.

WARNING: JWT realm does not support using the role_mapping.yml file.

==== JWT Realm Authorization via Role Mapping API

.If JWT realm role mapping is used for authorization, these claims are available for role mapping.
* `principal` claim: JWT claim in the form of a string is used as the {es} user's principal value.
* `dn` claim: JWT claim in the form of a Distinguished Name string is used as the {es} user's DN value.
* `groups` claim: JWT claim in the form of a comma separate list is used as the {es} user's groups value.
* `metadata` claims: JWTs claims in the form of strings, numbers, booleans, and collections are used as the {es} user's metadata, formatted as `jwt_claim_<key>` = `<value>`

See <<ref-jwt-settings>>.

==== JWT Realm Authorization via Delegated Authorization

.If Delegated Realms are used for authorization, this claim is available for roles lookup.
* `principal` claim: JWT claim in the form of a string is used as the {es} user's principal value.

See <<ref-jwt-settings>>.

WARNING: HMAC UTF-8 keys need to be longer than HMAC random byte keys to achieve same key strength.

===== Decoded JWT

This is a partial decoding of the JWT. It is for information only.

[source,text]
--------------------------------------------------
Header: {"typ":"JWT","alg":"HS256"}
Claims: {"aud":"aud8","sub":"security_test_user","iss":"iss8","exp":4070908800,"iat":946684800}
Signature: UnnFmsoFKfNmKMsVoDQmKI_3-j95PCaKdgqqau3jPMY
--------------------------------------------------

TIP: The validity period in this example is from 2000 to 2099, inclusive. JWTs typically have a shorter validity period than 100 years.

TIP: The signature in this example is deterministic because the header, claims, and HMAC key are fixed.
     {es} does not validate `nonce` claims, but adding it could inject entropy to vary the signature.
