=== JWT authentication

JWT realms enable {es} to treat some JWT identification tokens as authentication tokens.

Consider end-users authenticating to a third-party application via a third-party authentication service.
If the end-user authenticates successfully, the authentication service creates a JWT to identify
the authenticated end-user.

JWT may be issued to the third-party application, or directly to the end-user. If issued to
the third-party application, the third-party application performs actions on behalf
of the end-user, possibly in other third-party applications (e.g. microservices).

IMPORTANT: The above use cases utilize JWTs for identification only, not authentication.
           Example formats are Open ID Connect ID Tokens, or bespoke JWTs of similar format.

JWT realms allow {es} to treat some JWT identification tokens as authentication tokens.
Since a JWT represents the end-user, the third-party application needs to be authenticated too.
A separate client credential is required too, because the third-party application is a client of {es}.

WARNING: Client authentication is enabled by default in JWT realms.
         Client authentication can be disabled, but it is not recommended.
