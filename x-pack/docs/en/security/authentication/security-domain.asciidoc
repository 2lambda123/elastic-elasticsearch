=== Security domains

beta::[]

Security domains are a method of grouping different <<realms,realms>>
so that the {stack} can recognize when a single user authenticates with
these realms.

==== How security domains work

Some types of resources in {es} are owned by a single user.
For example <<async-search,async search contexts>>,
<<security-api-create-api-key,API keys>>,
and <<user-profile,user profiles>> each have an owning user.

When a user creates a resource, {es} captures the user's `username` and realm
information as part of the resource's metadata.
When the user attempts to access the resource at a later time, {es} compares
the captured `username` and realm information against those from the accessing
user. The access is not allowed unless both the realm and `username` match.
That is, if {es} detects that a `username` from two different realms is
attempting to access a resource, {es} assumes that these users are distinct and
doesn't allow resources to be shared between them.

However, there are cases where the same user can authenticate with
different realms and needs to share the same set of resources across the realms.
For example, an <<ldap-realm,LDAP realm>> and a <<saml-realm,SAML realm>> can
be backed by the same directory service. Additionally,
<<configuring-authorization-delegation,authorization delegation>> allows one
realm to delegate authorization to another realm. If both realms authenticate
users with the same `username`, it is reasonable to treat these users as the
same end-user identity from a resource ownership point of view.

With security domains, you can configure multiple realms to be under the same
domain, users can authenticate with any of the realms and have access to the
same set of resources regardless of which realm they authenticated with,
(provided those realms are under the same domain).
For example, a single <<user-profile,user profile>> is
associated to the user, enabling user preferences, notifications, and other
user data to be shared across domains. The same user can view results from an
asynchronous search request or a scrolling search. If the user has the
necessary privileges, they can also view and manage API keys across realms.

==== Configure a security domain

You specify the realms for a domain in `elasticsearch.yml`. The realms must
be defined in `elasticsearch.yml` (but do not need to be enabled).
Specifying either an undefined realm, synthetic realm, or the reserved realm
under a domain will prevent the node from starting.
A realm doesn't need to belong to a domain. If it does, the realm can only
belong to a single domain. Specifying a realm in multiple domains generates an
error when {es} starts.

NOTE: The <<file-realm,file realm>> and <<native-realm,native realm>> are
automatically enabled as `default_file`, and `default_native`, respectively,
without the need for explicit configuration. They can
be listed under domains even when they are not explicitly defined in
`elasticsearch.yml`.

. Add a security domain configuration to `elasticsearch.yml` under the
`xpack.security.authc.domains` namespace:
+
[source, yaml]
----
xpack:
  security:
    authc:
      domains:
        my_domain:
          realms: [ 'default_native', 'saml1' ] <1>
----
<1> This configuration defines a security domain called `my_domain`, which
contains two realms named `default_native` and `saml1`.

. Restart {es}.

[NOTE]
====
Though it's possible to configure different <<roles,roles>> for the same user when
authenticating with different realms, it is _not_ recommended.
Using <<configuring-authorization-delegation,authorization delegation>>
is a good way to ensure that a user is assigned the same roles from multiple realms.

{es} always enforces the privileges associated with the currently authenticated user.
Security domains don't bypass <<authorization,user authorization>> when
resource sharing requires them. For example, a user requires the
`manage_own_api_key` privilege to manage their own API keys. If that user does
not have this privilege when authenticating with one realm, they won't be able
to manage API keys while authenticating with this realm.
This behaviour might be unexpected since the same user may or may not be able
to perform the same operation depending on the realm it authenticates with.
But it is a safe behaviour that ensures actual actions always comply to
authorization requirements.
