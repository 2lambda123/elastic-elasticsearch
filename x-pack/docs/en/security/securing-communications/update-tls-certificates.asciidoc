[[update-node-certs]]
== Updating node security certificates
When updating your node security certificates, there are two main scenarios that
you'll encounter:

* <<update-node-certs-same,Your certificate authority (CA) or key remains the same>>
* <<update-node-certs-different,Your CA certificate or key changes>>

Regardless of the scenario, {es} monitors the SSL resources for updates
on a five-second interval. You can just copy the new certificate and key files
(or keystore) into the appropriate location and your nodes will detect the
changes. 

Because {es} doesn't reload the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration,
you must use *the same file names* so that {es} refreshes the security
certificates and keys. 

IMPORTANT: If you need to change a password for a key, keystore, or truststore
that is stored in the <<secure-settings,secure settings>>, then you must restart
the cluster. {es} will not reload changes for passwords stored in the secure
settings. We recommend rolling restarts when restarting the cluster.

.Rolling restarts are preferred
****
While it's possible to do an in-place update for security certificates, using
a <<restart-cluster-rolling,rolling restart>> on your cluster is safer. An in-place update avoids some
complications of a rolling restart, but incurs the following risks:

* If you use PEM files, your certificate and key are in separate files. You
must update both files _simultaneously_ or the node might experience a temporary
period where it cannot establish new connections.
* Updating the certificate and key does not automatically force existing
connections to refresh. This means that even if you make a mistake, a node can
seem like it's functioning but only because it still has existing connections.
It's possible that a node will be unable to connect with other nodes, rendering
it unable to recover from a network outage or node restart.

[[update-node-certs-same]]
=== Update security certificates with the same CA
++++
<titleabbrev>With the same CA</titleabbrev>
++++

If your CA hasn't changed, you can just generate a new certificate, save it with
the same name as your existing certificate, and replace the existing file.
You'll need to generate new certificates and keys for both the transport layer
and the HTTP layer.

This procedure assumes that the you have access to the CA certificate and key
that was originally generated (or otherwise held by your organization) and used
to sign the certificate that is currently in use. It also assumes that the
clients connecting to {es} on the HTTP layer are configured to trust the CA
certificate.

TIP: If your CA has changed, complete the steps in 
<<update-node-certs-different,update security certificates with a different CA>>.

[[node-certs-same-transport]]
==== Generate a new certificate for the transport layer
Create a new PKCS#12 file that contains the a certificate and key and replace
the existing PKCS#12 file (such as `elastic-certificates.p12`) with the new
certificate. 

NOTE: The following examples use PKCS#12 files, but the same steps apply to JKS keystores.

. Open the `ES_PATH_CONF/elasticsearch.yml` file and check the names of the
security certificates that are currently in use. You'll use the same names
for your new certificate.
+
In this example, the keystore and truststore are pointing to different files.
Your configuration might use the same file that contains the certificate and CA.

[[cert-password-updates]] If your certificate is password protected, the password is stored in the {es} keystore, _and_ the password needs to change, then you must perform a <<restart-cluster-rolling,rolling restart>> on your cluster. Complete the steps until the step that indicates *Perform any needed changes*, and then continue to the next step to replace your existing certificates.

. Replace your existing certificate with the new certificate, ensuring that the
file names match.

. Repeat the previous step on each node in your cluster to update the existing certificate, completing a rolling restart beforehand if your certificate matches the password stipulations outlined in <<cert-password-updates,this step>>.

[[node-certs-same-http]]
==== Generate a new certificate for the HTTP layer
This certificate is used to verify other components when they connect to {es},
such as {kib} or any of the Elastic language clients.

. Stop {es} and {kib} if they are running.

. From the directory where you installed {es}, run the {es} HTTP certificate 
tool.
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/elasticsearch-certutil http
----
+
This command generates a `.zip` file that contains certificates and keys
to use with {es} and {kib}. Each folder contains a `README.txt`
explaining how to use these files.

   a. When asked if you want to generate a CSR, enter `n`.

   b. When asked if you want to use an existing CA, enter `y`.

   c. Enter the absolute path to your CA, such as the path to the
    `elastic-stack-ca.p12` file.

   d. Enter the password for your CA.

   e. Enter an expiration value for your certificate. You can enter the
   validity period in years, months, or days. For example, enter `90D` for 90
   days.

   f. When asked if you want to generate one certificate per node, enter `y`.
+
Each certificate will have its own private key, and will be issued for a
specific hostname or IP address.

   g. When prompted, enter the name of the first node in your cluster. Use the
   same node name as the value for the `node.name` parameter in the
   `elasticsearch.yml` file.

   h. Enter all hostnames used to connect to your first node. These hostnames
   will be added as DNS names in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field in your certificate.
+
List every hostname and variant used to connect to your cluster over HTTPS.

   i. Enter the IP addresses that clients can use to connect to your node.

   j. Repeat these steps for each additional node in your cluster.

. After generating a certificate for each of your nodes, enter a password for
   your private key when prompted.

. Unzip the generated `elasticsearch-ssl-http.zip` file. This compressed file
   contains one directory for both {es} and {kib}.

. Repeat the previous steps on each node in your cluster to update the existing certificate, completing a rolling restart beforehand if your certificate matches the password stipulations outlined in <<cert-password-updates-https,this step>>.

[[update-node-certs-different]]
=== Update security certificates with a different CA
++++
<titleabbrev>With a different CA</titleabbrev>
++++
If your CA needs to change or has already changed, you'll need to generate a new
CA certificate and key. You can then add this CA certificate to your existing CA
truststore so that all nodes in your cluster so know and trust it. Then,
generate new certificate/key pairs for each node that are signed by the new CA
and instruct your nodes to use the new files. 

[[node-certs-different-transport]]
==== Generate a new certificate for the transport layer
Create a new CA certificate and add it to your existing CA truststore. 

NOTE: The following examples use PKCS#12 files, but the same steps apply to JKS
keystores.

. Open the `ES_PATH_CONF/elasticsearch.yml` file and check the names of the
security certificates that are currently in use. You'll use the same names
for your new certificates.
+
In this example, the keystore and truststore are using different files.
Your configuration might use the same file for both the keystore and the 
truststore. We recommend using separate files. 
+
[source,yaml]

xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.type: PKCS12
xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.password: password
----

. On *any* node in your cluster, generate a new CA certificate. You only need
to complete this step once.
+
NOTE: If your organization has its own CA, then use that CA to generate a new
CA certificate in PEM format.
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/elasticsearch-certutil ca --pem
----
+
[%collapsible%open]
.Command parameters
====
   `--pem`:: Generates a directory containing a CA certificate and
    key in PEM format instead of PKCS#12. 
====

    a. Enter a name for the compressed output file that will contain your
    certificate and key, or accept the default name of `elastic-stack-ca.zip`.

    b. Unzip the output file. The resulting directory contains a CA certificate
    (`ca.crt`) and private key (`ca.key`).
+
--
IMPORTANT: Keep these file in a secure location as they contain the private key
for your CA. 
--

. On *every* node in your cluster, import the new `ca.crt` certificate into your
existing CA truststore. This step ensures that your cluster trusts the new CA
certificate. This example uses the Java `keytool` utility to import the
certificate into the `elastic-stack-ca.p12` CA truststore.
+
[source,shell]
----
keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -noprompt -keystore elastic-stack-ca.p12 \

.Command parameters
====
   `-keystore`:: Name of the truststore that you are importing the new CA
   certificate into. 

   `-storepass`:: Password for the CA truststore. 

   `-alias`:: Name that you want to assign to the new CA certificate.

   `-file`:: Name of the new CA certificate to import.
====

. Check that the new CA certificate was added to your truststore. The output
should contain both the existing CA certificate and your new certificate. Each
CA certificate is identified by the `friendlyName` attribute in the output.
+
When prompted, enter the password for the CA truststore.
+
[source,shell]
----
openssl pkcs12 -info -in config/elastic-stack-ca.p12

[[node-certs-different-nodes]]
==== Generate a new certificate for each node in your cluster
Now that your CA truststore is updated, use your new CA certificate to sign
a certificate for each node in your cluster. Rather than run the
`elasticsearch-certutil` tool once for each node, create an `instances.yml` file
that contains information about each of your nodes. You can then use the
`elasticsearch-certutil` tool to generate certificates for all of your nodes
with a single command.

. On any node in your cluster, create an `instances.yml` file that contains
information about each of your nodes. Include all IP addresses and DNS names
that you use to identify each node. 
+
[source,yaml]
----
instances:
  - name: "node1"
    ip:
      - "192.168.1.101"
    dns:
      - "node1"
      - "node1.mydomain.com"
  - name: "node2"
    ip:
      - "192.168.1.102"
    dns:
      - "node2"
      - "node2.mydomain.com"
  - name: "node3"
    ip:
      - "192.168.1.103"
    dns:
      - "node3"
      - "node3.mydomain.com"
  - name: "node4"
    ip:
      - "192.168.1.104"
    dns:
      - "node4"
      - "node4.mydomain.com"
----

. Using the new CA certificate and key, create a new certificate for each node
in your cluster. Include the `instances.yml` file that you created previously.
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert --in instances.yml --ca-cert ca/ca.crt \
--ca-key ca/ca.key
----
+
[%collapsible%open]
.Command parameters
====
   `-in`:: Specifies the name of the input YAML file (`instances.yml`)
   containing information about each of your nodes.

   `--ca-cert`:: Specifies the path to your new CA certificate (`ca.crt`) in PEM
   format. You must also specify the `--ca-key` parameter.

   `--ca-key`:: Specifies the path to the private key (`ca.key`) for your CA
   certificate. You must also specify the `--ca-cert` parameter.
====

   a. Enter a name for the output file or accept the default of
   `certificate-bundle.zip`.

   b. When prompted, enter a password for each node certificate. It's good
   practice to use a different password for each node certificate and store the
   files in a secure location.

   c. Decompress the `certificate-bundle.zip` file. The output contains a
   directory for each of your nodes with a `<node-name>.p12` file.

. On *every* node, copy the appropriate node certificate to the `ES_PATH_CONF`
directory.
+
NOTE: The `ES_PATH_CONF` variable is the path for the {es}
configuration files. If you installed {es} using archive distributions
(`zip` or `tar.gz`), the variable defaults to `ES_HOME/config`. If you used
package distributions (Debian or RPM), the variable defaults to `/etc/elasticsearch`.

. If the name of your new node certificate doesn't match the name of the
existing certificate, modify the `elasticsearch.yml` file to update the
`keystore.path` variable with the new name. For example, `node-1.p12`.
+
