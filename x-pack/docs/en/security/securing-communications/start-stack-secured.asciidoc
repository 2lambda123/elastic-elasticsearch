[[start-stack-secured]]
=== Start {es} with security enabled by default
When you start {es} for the first time, {es} automatically generates a password
for the built-in `elastic` user, creates keystores for the HTTP and transport
layers, and persists the updated security configuration to your cluster's
`elasticsearch.yml` file.
