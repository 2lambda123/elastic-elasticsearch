=== Setting passwords for native and built-in users

After you implement security, you might need or want to change passwords for
different users. You can use the <<reset-password,`elasticsearch-reset-password`>>
tool or the <<security-api-change-password,change passwords API>> to change
passwords for native and <<built-in-users,built-in users>>. 

For example, the following command changes the password for a user with the
username `elastic` user to an auto-generated value and prints the new password
to the terminal:

[source,shell]
----
bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u user1
----

If you want to set the password to a specific value, use the change passwords
API:

////
POST _security/user/user1?refresh=true
{
  "password" : "l0ng-r4nd0m-p@ssw0rd",
  "roles": ["admin"]
}
////

[source,console]
----
POST /_security/user/user1/_password
{
  "password" : "new-test-password"
}
----
