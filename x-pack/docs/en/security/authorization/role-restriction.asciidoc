[[role-restriction]]
=== Role restriction

Role restriction can be used to specify conditions under which a role should be effective.
Not specifying restriction means a role is not restricted and thus always effective.
This is the default behaviour.

--
NOTE: Currently, the role restriction is only supported for <<security-api-create-api-key, API keys>>,
with limitation that it's allowed to specify only a single role descriptor with restriction.

[[workflows-restriction]]
==== Workflows

Workflows allow to restrict the role to be effective exclusively when calling certain REST APIs.
Calling a REST API that is not allowed by a workflow, will result in the role being disabled (i.e. _empty_) and thus access being denied.
The below section lists workflows that you can restrict the role to:

`search_application_query`::: This workflow restricts the role to the <<search-application-search, Search Application Search API>> only.

--
NOTE: Workflows are case-sensitive.
