=== Forwarding audit logs to a remote cluster

When you are <<auditing,auditing security events>>, you can optionally forward 
the audit logs to a remote cluster. 

The logs are sent to the remote cluster by using the 
{javaclient}/transport-client.html[transport client]. To establish the 
connection from the transport client to the remote cluster, configure the following `xpack.security.audit.index.client` settings:

* `xpack.security.audit.index.client.hosts`
* `xpack.security.audit.index.client.cluster.name`
* `xpack.security.audit.index.client.xpack.security.user`

NOTE: If the remote {es} cluster has Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) enabled, you 
must specify extra settings. 

For more information about these settings, see
{ref}/auditing-settings.html#remote-audit-settings[Remote audit log indexing configuration settings].
