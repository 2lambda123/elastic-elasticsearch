[[configuring-stack-security]]
== Start the Elastic Stack with security enabled

beta::[This functionality is in alpha and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Alpha features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.]

Before you start {es} for the first time, run the `elasticsearch-security-config`
tool. This tool generates certificates and keys for the transport and HTTP
layers of {es}, and writes the Transport Layer Security (TLS) configuration
settings to `elasticsearch.yml`. These certificates allows you to connect a
{kib} to your secured {es} cluster and encrypt internode communication.

When you start {es} for the first time, passwords are automatically generated
for the `elastic` and `kibana_system` users. Tools are available to reset these
passwords if you misplace them or need to rotate passwords.

You can then use the
<<create-enrollment-token,`elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token>> tool to
generate separate enrollment tokens for connecting a {kib} instance to your
secured {es} cluster and enrolling additional nodes. 

When you complete the enrollment process, {kib} applies the security settings
from your {es} cluster, authenticates to {es} with the `kibana_system` user,
and writes the security configuration to `kibana.yml`.

A security certificate is generated in the {kib} configuration directory. This
file establishes trust between {kib} and the {es} Certificate Authority (CA) for
the HTTP layer.

=== Prerequisites

* https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch#preview-release[Download] and
unpack the `elasticsearch 8.0.0-alpha2` package distribution for your
environment.
* https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana#preview-release[Download] and unpack
the `kibana 8.0.0-alpha2` package distribution for your environment.

[[stack-generate-certificates]]
=== Generate security certificates
. Before starting {es} for the first time, run the
`elasticsearch-security-config` tool from the directory where you downloaded
the {es} package distribution:
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/elasticsearch-security-config
----
+
The `elasticsearch-security-config` tool generates the following security
certificates and keys in `config/tls_auto_config_initial_node_<timestamp>`:
+
--
`http_ca.crt`::
The CA certificate that is used to sign the certificates for the HTTP layer of
this {es} cluster.

`http_keystore_local_node.p12`::
Keystore that contains the key and certificate for the HTTP layer for this node.

`transport_keystore_all_nodes.p12`::
Keystore that contains the key and certificate for the transport layer for all the nodes in your cluster.
--

[[stack-start-with-security]]
=== Start {es} and enroll {kib} with security enabled
. From the installation directory, start {es}. Passwords for the `elastic` and 
`kibana_system` users are generated and output to the terminal. You might need
to scroll back a bit to view the passwords.
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/elasticsearch
----
+
Copy the generated passwords and save them in a secure location. The passwords
are shown only when you start {es} for the first time.
+
NOTE: If you need to reset the password for the `elastic` user, run the
<<reset-elastic-password,`elasticsearch-reset-elastic-password`>> tool. To
reset the password for the `kibana_system` user, run the 
`elasticsearch-reset-kibana-system-password` tool. Both of these tools are
available in the {es} `/bin` directory.

. Verify that you can connect to your {es} cluster by making an authenticated
call. Enter the password for the `elastic` user when prompted:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl --cacert config/tls_auto_config_initial_node_<timestamp>/http_ca.crt \
-u elastic https://localhost:9200
----
// NOTCONSOLE
+
`--cacert`::
Path to the generated `http_ca.crt` certificate for the HTTP layer.

. Open another terminal, navigate to the directory where you installed {es}, and
run the <<create-enrollment-token,`elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token`>> tool
to generate an enrollment token for {kib}.
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
----
+
Copy the enrollment token, which you'll use to enroll {kib} with your {es}
cluster.

. From the directory where you installed {kib}, start {kib} in interactive mode.
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/kibana --interactiveSetup.enabled=true
----
+
This command generates a unique link to enroll your {kib} instance with {es}.

. In your terminal, click the link to open {kib} in your browser.

. In your browser, paste the enrollment token that you copied previously and
click the button to connect your {kib} instance with {es}.

. Log in to {kib} as the `elastic` user. Use this superuser account to 
{kibana-ref}/tutorial-secure-access-to-kibana.html[manage spaces, create new users, and assign roles].

[discrete]
[[stack-enroll-nodes]]
=== Enroll additional nodes in your cluster
. In a separate terminal from where {es} is running, navigate to the directory
where you installed {es} and run the
<<create-enrollment-token,`elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token`>> tool
to generate an enrollment token for your additional nodes.
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node
----
+
Copy the enrollment token, which you'll use to enroll additional nodes with
your {es} cluster.

. From the installation directory of your other node, run the
`elasticsearch-enroll-node` tool and pass your enrollment token with the
`--enrollment token` parameter.
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/elasticsearch-enroll-node --enrollment token <enrollment-token>
----

. Start your new node, which {es} automatically enrolls into the existing
cluster.

=== What's next?
Congrats! You've successfully started the {stack} with security enabled. {es}
and {kib} are secured with TLS on the HTTP layer, and internode communication
is encrypted. If you want to enable HTTPS, you
can <<encrypt-kibana-browser,encrypt traffic between your browser and {kib}>>.
