=== Operator-only functionality
Operator privileges provides protection for APIs and dynamic cluster settings.
Any API or cluster setting that is protected by operator privileges is known as _operator-only functionality_
When the operator privileges feature is enabled, operator-only APIs may only be executed by an
operator user. Likewise, operator-only settings may only be updated by operator users.
The list of operator-only APIs and dynamic cluster settings are pre-determined in the codebase.
They may evolve in future releases, but are otherwise fixed in a given {es} version.
