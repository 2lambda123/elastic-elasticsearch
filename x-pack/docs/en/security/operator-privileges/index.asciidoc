== Operator Privileges

include::operator-privileges-designed-for-note.asciidoc[]

With a typical {es} deployment, people who administer the cluster also operates the cluster at the infrastructure level.
The RBAC <<authorization>> is effective and reliable for this environment.
However, in more managed environments, such as {ess-trial}[{ess}], there is a distinction between the operator
of the cluster infrastructure and the administrator of the cluster.
The operator privileges feature enhances the {es} security model so that some functionality
is restricted to be used by infrastructure operators and is not available to cluster administrators,
even if they log in as a highly privileged user (such as `superuser`).
