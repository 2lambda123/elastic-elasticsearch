== Operator privileges

include::operator-privileges-designed-for-note.asciidoc[]

With a typical {es} deployment, people who administer the cluster also operate
the cluster at the infrastructure level. User authorization based on
<<authorization,role-based access control (RBAC)>> is effective and reliable for
this environment. However, in more managed environments, such as
{ess-trial}[{ess}], there is a distinction between the operator of the cluster
infrastructure and the administrator of the cluster. The operator privileges
feature enhances the {es} security model so that some functionality is
restricted to infrastructure operators only. This functionality is not available
to cluster administrators--even if they log in as a highly privileged user such
as the `elastic` user or another user with the `superuser` role.
