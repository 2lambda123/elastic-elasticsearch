=== Operator Privileges and Snapshot/Restore
The invocation of <<operator-only-apis>> and changes to <<operator-only-dynamic-cluster-settings>>
result changes in the cluster state, which can be <<snapshot-restore,snapshot and restored>>.
Restoring snapshot data associated to <<operator-only-functionality,operator-only functionality>>
is problematic because:

1. A snapshot could contain wrong values for operator-only functionalities. Restore them
   could break the cluster.
2. Even if we could correct the values immediately after the restore, there will always be
   a short time period where cluster could be in an inconsistent state.
3. We prefer configure operator-only functionality from a single place, i.e. through API calls.

Therefore, <<configure-operator-privileges,*when the feature of operator privileges is enabled*>>,
snapshot data associated to any operator-only functionality are *not* restored.

NOTE: They are still included when taking a snapshot so that all data are always preserved.
