=== Enhancements

Machine Learning::
* Added `xpack.ml.max_open_jobs` as a node attribute. See
{ref}/ml-settings.html[Machine Learning Settings in {es}]
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2203[#2203] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/2185[#2185])
// * Added the ability to force close and force delete jobs in the "closing" state.
// HIDE already mentioned in 5.5 RN: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/1534[#1534]

Security::
* Added the `keystore.seed` setting to create a randomly generated bootstrap
password if an actual password is not present.
//TBD: Is there documentation we can link to for this new setting?
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2295[#2295] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/26253[#26253])
* The `bootstrap.password` secure setting is now managed locally on each node

// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2272[#2272]

when using the token service. The cluster automatically generates a secure key
on startup. See {ref}/security-settings.html[Security Settings in {es}].
