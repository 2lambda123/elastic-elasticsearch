=== Breaking Changes

Security::
* A new bootstrap check enforces that default passwords are disabled for the
built-in users when running in
{ref}/bootstrap-checks.html#_development_vs_production_mode[production mode].
You must set `xpack.security.authc.accept_default_password` to `false` in your
`elasticsearch.yml`. For more information, see <<security-settings>> and
{xpack-ref}/setting-up-authentication.html[Setting Up User Authentication].
* A new configuration setting is available to disable support for the default
password (_"changeme"_). For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/setting-up-authentication.html#disabling-default-password[Disable Default Password Functionality].

Watcher::
* The built-in HTTP client used in webhooks, the http input and the http email attachment has been replaced.
This results in the need to always escape all parts of an URL.
* The new built-in HTTP client also enforces a maximum request size, which defaults to 10mb.
