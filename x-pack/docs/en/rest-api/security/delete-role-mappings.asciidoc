=== Delete role mappings API

Removes role mappings.

==== Request

`DELETE /_xpack/security/role_mapping/<name>` 

//==== Description

==== Path Parameters

`name`::
 (string) The distinct name that identifies the role mapping. The name is
  used solely as an identifier to facilitate interaction via the API; it does
  not affect the behavior of the mapping in any way. If you do not specify this
  parameter for the Get Role Mappings API, it returns information about all
  role mappings.


==== Request Body

The following parameters can be specified in the body of a PUT or POST request
and pertain to adding a role mapping:

`enabled` (required)::
(boolean)  Mappings that have `enabled` set to `false` are ignored when role
mapping is performed.

`metadata`::
(object) Additional metadata that helps define which roles are assigned to each
user. Within the `metadata` object, keys beginning with `_` are reserved for
system usage.

`roles` (required)::
(list) A list of roles that are granted to the users that match the role-mapping
rules.

`rules` (required)::
(object) The rules that determine which users should be matched by the mapping.
A rule is a logical condition that is expressed by using a JSON DSL.


==== Authorization

To use this API, you must have at least the `manage_security` cluster privilege.


==== Examples

To delete a role mapping, submit a DELETE request to the
`/_xpack/security/role_mapping/<name>` endpoint:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
DELETE /_xpack/security/role_mapping/mapping1
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:role_mapping]

If the mapping is successfully deleted, the request returns `{"found": true}`.
Otherwise, `found` is set to false.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "found" : true
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TESTRESPONSE
