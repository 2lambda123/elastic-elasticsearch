[[security-api-update-api-key-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`PUT /_security/api_key/<id>`

[[security-api-update-api-key-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* To use this API, you must have at least the `manage_own_api_key` cluster privilege.

IMPORTANT: Only the user who created an API key can update it.
// TODO Don't hardcode?
Other users, including `superuser`, cannot.
It's not possible to use an API key as the authentication credential for this API.
Doing so will result in an error.

[[security-api-update-api-key-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

The API keys created by <<security-api-create-api-key,create API Key>> can be updated using this API.
The roles assigned to an API key and API key metadata can be updated by specifying them in the request.
Several other fields are updated automatically on every call.
It's not possible to update expired API keys, or API keys that have been invalidated by <<security-api-invalidate-api-key,invalidate API Key>>

[[security-api-update-api-key-request-body]]
==== {api-request-body-title}

// TODO path param

IMPORTANT: Regardless of whether any parameters are specified, the _point in time snapshot of permissions of the authenticated user_ is always updated.

The following parameters can be specified in the body of a PUT request:

`role_descriptors`::
(Optional, array-of-role-descriptor) An array of new role descriptors for this API key.
This parameter is optional.
When specified, the new role descriptors replace those currently assigned to this API key.
When it is not specified, the API key keeps its previously assigned role descriptors.
If you supply role descriptors then the resultant permissions would be an intersection of API keys permissions and authenticated user's permissions thereby limiting the access scope for API keys.
The structure of role descriptor is the same as the request for create role API.
For more details, see <<security-api-put-role, create or update roles API>>.
