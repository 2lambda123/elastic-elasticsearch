=== Delete tokens API

Invalidates bearer tokens for access without requiring basic authentication.

==== Request

`DELETE /_xpack/security/oauth2/token`

==== Description

The tokens returned by the <<security-api-get-token,get tokens API>> have a 
finite period of time for which they are valid and after that time period, they 
can no longer be used. That time period is defined by the 
`xpack.security.authc.token.timeout` setting. For more information, see 
<<token-service-settings>>.

If you want to invalidate a token immediately, use this delete tokens API.


==== Request Body

The following parameters can be specified in the body of a DELETE request and
pertain to deleting a token:

`token` (required)::
(string) An access token.

==== Examples

The following example invalidates the specified token immediately:
