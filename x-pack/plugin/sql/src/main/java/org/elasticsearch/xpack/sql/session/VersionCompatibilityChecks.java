/**
 * The class contains checks gating newly introduced functionality that is exposed to clients, but not supported by those older than the
 * version introducing the respective feature.
 * Each new feature will have a method added, taking a version and returning a boolean reflecting that version's support of the feature.
 * The comparison can only have the equal added once the feature is backported (see JdbcTestUtils.java). Example:
 * <code>
 *     public static boolean supportsUnsignedLong(SqlVersion version) {
 *         // TODO: add equality only once actually ported to 7.11
 *         return VERSION_INTRODUCING_UNSIGNED_LONG.compareTo(version) &lt; 0;
 *     }
