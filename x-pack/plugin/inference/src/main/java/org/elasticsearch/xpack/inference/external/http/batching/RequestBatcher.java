/**
 * Things to think about:
 *  - A single sender will be used for ALL requests for a single service. For example the {@link org.elasticsearch.xpack.inference.services.huggingface.elser.HuggingFaceElserService}
 *  will only have one sender, therefore we will need to handle when the account information is separate (if there are different api keys
 *  then we can't combine the requests)
 *  - If the URLs are different then they need to be separate requests
 *  - What do we do if we drain 2 requests and they need to be separate? Just iterate of the requests?
 *      - What if we get a shutdown while we're doing that? No different then how things are currently, we can't cancel requests
 *      - If the current request fails for some reason, it should go through the onFailure logic and likely be retried but that'll just
 *          end back on the queue so that should be fine
 *  - We need something to track the parts of a batch
 *      - A request can have multiple input but they should all be associated with a single request when onResponse is called for that listener
 *      - We'll need to track a range within the array for that
